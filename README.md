# Working With Data: Spring 2020

This repository is an archive of work completed for DATA 73500 taught by Professor Timothy Shortell at the CUNY Graduate Center during the Spring 2020 semester.

## Assignments

Assignments were mostly completed within Jupyter notebooks, except when consisting only of text/graph output. Content ranges from purely quantitative analysis to natural language processing of text data.

## Final Project: Summons in the City

Summons in the City is an overarching view of NYPD criminal summons from 2005-2019. Using records provided by NYCOpenData, this project delves into how demographics affect the likelihood of being issued a summons, and what category of summons a person is likely to receive based on their demographics. [The dataset used in this project can be found here.](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Criminal-Court-Summons-Historic-/sv2w-rv3k)
