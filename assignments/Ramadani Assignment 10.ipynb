This dataset was a tough one to visualize, mainly because it doesn't have any real quantitative statistics. Everything is demographic and categorical, so I relied mainly on number of records. Still, the number of summons can tell a really interesting story.\n",

Additionally, TLC offenses also went up in 2016, following certain policy implemenatations. In the next few parts of this section, we'll take a look at demographic data for a select number of these summons categories."
