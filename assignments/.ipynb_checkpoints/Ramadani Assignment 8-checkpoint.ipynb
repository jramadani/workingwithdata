      "['Ireland Puts Its Anthony Fauci Front and Center\\nThrusting once-anonymous health experts into leadership, however, creates a tension when political decisions must be made.\\nAlex Wong / Brian Smialowski / Getty / The Atlantic\\nLink Copied\\nAround the corner from Dublin’s historic St. Stephen’s Green lie Ireland’s Government Buildings. Here sit the offices of the Irish prime minister—or Taoiseach. Since February, political ownership of this most prized piece of real estate has been up for grabs, following a general-election result that left no party with a clear claim to power. Then the pandemic struck.\\nIreland looked up from its own troubles to see the coronavirus outbreak hurtling toward its shores. It had a diminished leader, a political crisis, and a health system that had for decades been a source of domestic controversy, dispute, and angst. Yet, three months on, the incumbent, Leo Varadkar, remains in situ, and most pundits now expect him to stay in office as part of a power-sharing arrangement. And while Ireland’s response to the pandemic has been far from perfect, particularly in relation to retirement homes and testing, its overall performance appears to have held up in comparison to many other European nations. In fact, Ireland today finds itself watching the two countries it knows best—Britain and the United States—with a partially justified (though rarely acknowledged) sense of schadenfreude.\\nIreland’s experience, however, illustrates only part of the pandemic’s counterintuitive leadership story, in which political strength appears to offer no obvious guide to national performance. The other part is the emergence of largely anonymous public-health experts as overnight celebrities, trusted authorities, and, to varying degrees, surrogate leaders. In war, it is generals who vie with prime ministers and presidents for power and affection; today it is chief medical officers.\\nIreland, along with the U.K. and the U.S., is a prime example of this trend. Ten minutes’ walk from the prime minister’s office, a mural has gone up on the boarded-up window of a pub, paying tribute to the country’s leadership through the pandemic. It depicts a balding, middle-aged man in a suit, opening his shirt to reveal a Superman-style top with the letters TH emblazoned across his chest. This is Tony Holohan, a physician and Ireland’s chief medical officer—the man whose advice is at least partly responsible for shutting the pub in the first place.\\nHolohan and his counterparts Anthony Fauci in the U.S. and Chris Whitty in Britain have been thrust into positions of authority, power, and influence at a time when worried populations are looking for guidance. Their sudden prominence reveals as much about the political culture in which they operate as it does about the advice they have given. Yet it also raises questions about the nature of leadership in modern crises—and the temptation among today’s leaders to avoid taking responsibility for the controversial decisions required to manage them.\\nRead: America is thirsty for Anthony Fauci\\nIn the U.S., Fauci, the plainspoken avatar of the White House’s coronavirus task force, has given credibility to a president whom most Americans don’t trust to tell the truth. Yet Donald Trump never likes to be upstaged, and he’s begun to publicly clash with Fauci over the timetable for rebooting the economy. Fauci has called for a cautious approach, predicting that states could see a spike in infections and endure needless “suffering and death” should they reopen prematurely.\\nAfter Fauci delivered his warning at a Senate hearing last week, Trump rebuked him, renewing speculation about whether the president was preparing to part ways with the respected infectious-disease expert who has advised the past six administrations. “He wants to play all sides of the equation,” Trump told reporters last week. Fauci, 79, is the rare senior government official who’s unafraid to tell the president uncomfortable truths, and has shown no sign that he’s inclined to back down or trim his advice to fit Trump’s political imperatives.\\nAsked in a recent interview with The Atlantic about how he’s evolved into a pop-culture icon—his face is imprinted on bobblehead dolls—Fauci said simply: “This country is looking for truth and honesty, and looking for someone who tells it like it is.” He continued, “I happen to be the right person at the right time. But I really don’t take that personally and say, It’s about me and I’m such a great thing. It’s what the country needs. I happen to be the figure that’s there, and that they’re latching on to.”\\nThe obvious difficulty for Fauci in particular, but also for Holohan and Whitty, is that sometimes political leaders do not like to hear how it is. Still, leaders must consider more than one truth when weighing how to act, and cannot just leave it to their generals to make decisions for them. If there is a trade-off between epidemiological and economic considerations, this is an inherently political problem, not a medical one.\\nRead: Anthony Fauci, lightning rod\\nIn the U.S., there now appears to be a willingness to prioritize economic concerns over medical advice ahead of November’s general election. By contrast, in the U.K. and Ireland, politicians remain much more closely aligned with their advisers, insisting that they are being “led by the science” and will not do anything that contradicts medical expertise. Such proximity, however, is a double-edged sword, and not only for the public in each country, but the advisers themselves. The danger for Holohan and Whitty is that while their immediate job prospects might look far more secure than Fauci’s, the continued political deference to their expertise potentially leaves them more exposed to scapegoating, as well as unfair pressure that they are somehow responsible for balancing considerations that rightly belong to elected politicians.\\nUnlike in Britain and the U.S., where daily coronavirus updates are led by politicians, in Ireland the press conference is chaired by Holohan himself. With the country shut down, Holohan is the man with the information and the authority to whom the public has been asked to turn. In Fauci’s words, he is the man telling it like it is, and the reviews have been positive.\\nThough it remains early in terms of Ireland’s overall response, and the cause of the country’s success is still up for debate, most of the people that I spoke with in Dublin—including a senior member of the government, a former senior official, and political journalists—agreed that the emergence of “Dr. T” had been an essential part of the Irish story so far, helping to foster a sense of social unity that was not as clearly on display in the U.S. and Britain, where politicians had been more obviously front and center each day.\\nHolohan’s prominence and the lack of a permanent new government, however, is beginning to be noticed, those I spoke with said. While Holohan has thus far been accepted as a leading voice in the crisis, he cannot be expected to be responsible for the kind of trade-offs that will be necessary as Ireland tries to emerge from the lockdown. “There’s a sense, now, that the absence of a government is becoming an issue,” the former official, who is still in touch with senior government figures and privy to internal discussions, told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\\nIndeed, Holohan is beginning to face questions about the problems in Ireland’s retirement-home sector. Given his central importance and public position, he is in the firing line as much as his political masters. The potential criticism raises questions about how government advisers can be held to account when they are not elected—and, equally, how they can be protected from being scapegoated by politicians whose job it is to make the decisions.\\nRead: America’s patchwork pandemic is fraying even further\\nSimilar questions are now being asked in Britain, where, contrary to the public perception, Boris Johnson is much closer in behavior and outlook to Varadkar and other European leaders than he is to Trump. Like those other leaders, Johnson has been at pains to insist throughout that he has followed the science and to ensure there is little difference in messaging between himself and his expert advisers. As in Ireland, this has led to increased support for Johnson—but also widespread trust and support for Whitty. And just like in Ireland, Whitty has also found himself depicted in public art . (In contrast to Holohan, however, he has not appeared in public every day, and when he does, he typically stands alongside the prime minister and a second adviser.) As in Ireland, attention is beginning to turn to what went wrong and the toxic question of who is to blame.\\nWhether in Dublin, London, or Washington, we are looking to our modern-day generals for leadership, truth, expertise, and clarity. But for their sake as much as ours, we should not forget who is in charge. The buck doesn’t stop with Holohan, Whitty, or Fauci—but with Varadkar, Johnson, and Trump.\\nPeter Nicholas contributed reporting.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

That makes them a challenge to operate amid a deadly outbreak.\\nOr as Paul LeBlanc, the president of Southern New Hampshire University, told Adam Harris back in April : “If you were to design a place to make sure that everyone gets the virus, it would look like a nursing home or a campus.”\\nMy colleague Adam, whose education coverage is always must-read, has been reporting on the nightmare universities face this fall .\\nHere are three questions university presidents are thinking about in advance of the coming semester:\\n1. How will schools keep on-campus residences and facilities safe?\\nIf campus officials bring students back and then have to send them home again in the event of an outbreak, will students be willing to pay for this on-again, off-again college experience?

Is it worth it?\\nMay 21, 2020\\nLink Copied\\nOn the latest episode of the Social Distance podcast, James Hamblin and Katherine Wells ask the infectious-disease expert Stephen Thomas to explain the medical and ethical issues involved in developing a new vaccine.\\nListen to the episode here:\\nSubscribe to Social Distance on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or another podcast platform to receive new episodes as soon as they’re published.\\nWhat follows is an edited and condensed transcript of their conversation.\\nKatherine Wells: I don’t actually understand how vaccines are developed on any sort of granular level.\\nJames Hamblin: How do you go from this tiny prototype in eight people where they didn’t seem to be harmed, to a billion people with a needle in their arm? It is a technical process that could go a few different ways, depending on our capacity or willingness to incur risk. We can play it really safe and do it really slow, but lots of people are dying every day of this disease. There are incentives right now to take risks that usually vaccine-development people wouldn’t take.\\nAn idea that is being discussed in vaccine circles is “human challenge trials,” which we’ve done for some other viruses, but they are not being done right now for this coronavirus. They involve giving people one of these test vaccines and then purposefully exposing them, in a standardized way, to the virus. When you have a disease like this, you have to get a huge number of people with the test vaccine and then see what percentage gets sick and what percentage doesn’t. But [with a regular trial] you don’t really know who is actually exposed [to the virus]. How many of those people who didn’t get sick just didn’t get sick because they were staying at home with their huge bag of Purell?\\nWells: So a challenge trial would speed up [the development process] because we would know exactly who was exposed?\\nHamblin: Right. You could say, 70 percent of the people who got the vaccine were protected, and 30 percent of them got sick. The problem is that would mean people got sick with a disease like this, and potentially even people died or had lasting complications. There’s obviously a big ethical dilemma there. But it could theoretically really speed up this process and make it more scientifically valid more quickly. It’s not happening right now, but some people are proposing that it should.\\nStephen Thomas is the chief of infectious disease at SUNY Upstate Medical University. His focus has been on researching vaccines.\\nWells: What is a challenge trial? And should we do it?\\nStephen Thomas: This is where we give a healthy human being a mild form of the disease that we are trying to study so that we can hasten the development of a countermeasure drug or a vaccine, or we can fill in some critical gap in information that we are not able to fill using standard, benchtop science or small animals like rats and mice. Challenge trials have been around for well over 100 years, and multiple diseases use challenge trials to support their development. Each disease has particular reasons why human challenge makes sense.\\nWells: A challenge trial is where you vaccinate someone and then you expose them deliberately to the virus to see if they get it. Is that right?\\nThomas: That’s the second step. The first step is exposure without the vaccine.\\nHamblin: You have people who have volunteered to be infected. How do you navigate that space about how someone can really consent to that, and who is willing, and why they would be willing to go through that?\\nThomas: There needs to be what we call “democratic deliberation.” There needs to be consensus among interested and disinterested parties, to include physicians and scientists and ethicists and regulators, that the disease that you’re talking about is appropriate for a human challenge. You’re not going to have a human challenge model for a chronic, incurable disease. You’re not going to have a human challenge trial where the risk to the individual is unacceptably high—that’s a whole discussion in and of itself. You’re not going to have a human challenge model where the risk to others, not just the person who volunteers, but other people, is unacceptably high.\\nThen you propose a plan to the ethical review committees and the FDA. Part of that plan is the informed-consent process, where you explain to the potential volunteers what the risks are and what the benefits are. And oftentimes, the only benefit is that they will be advancing science and that they might be able, through their sacrifice, to help somebody else.\\nWells: Do you think it’s likely that this global pandemic will create the necessary urgency to make whatever risks worth it? Do you think a challenge is going to happen?\\nThomas: There are too many unanswered questions about how we would actually do them. For me personally, I absolutely think it should be thought about, and it should be discussed. Challenge trials, in the right circumstances and under the right conditions, can be incredibly valuable. I put my money where my mouth is, not just because I do challenge trials, but I have volunteered for a challenge trial.\\nHamblin: What did you get?\\nThomas: Malaria. I was an infectious-disease fellow at the time, and I knew what I was going to do with my life. And I said, “Someday you’re going to have to say that you stepped up and actually did what you’re asking other people to do.”\\nHamblin: How did they expose you?\\nThomas: I got three vaccinations over a period of weeks and then waited for a month. And then I came back in, and they had five malaria-infected, very hungry mosquitoes in a little cup with a screen on top of it. I put my arm on the top of the cup, and the mosquitoes came up and fed on my blood. And then [the researchers] took the mosquitoes and took the salivary glands out of the mosquitoes, and they confirmed that each of the five mosquitoes had malaria.\\nWells: Did the vaccine work, or no?\\nThomas: As a matter of fact, it did.\\nWells: I imagined that there would be some highly scientific, tech-heavy process. But no, we just take malaria-infected mosquitoes and have them bite you.\\nThomas: This is a great point that you raise, because ideally, you would want to deliver the virus the same exact way that somebody would be exposed.\\nHamblin: Oh no. So for COVID-19, would people be coughed on?\\nThomas: That’s one of the questions: How are you going to deliver the virus?\\nWells: How much time do you save by going straight to a challenge?\\nThomas: If it worked really well, and the FDA believed that it worked really well, and the FDA said, “Listen, we will give you a license and allow you to sell your vaccine based on challenge data alone.” Then I think that’s one of the scenarios where we potentially could meet this warp-speed benchmark that has been put out there: [a vaccine] by the end of the year.\\nWells: I imagine even if we did challenge trials, it’s not guaranteed. A lot of other things would have to go really, really right for us to have a vaccine widely available by the end of the year.\\nThomas: That’s correct. Is it possible that we could be on the doorstep of having a vaccine by the end of the year? Sure, it’s possible. Is it likely? No. There’s a lot of open boxes that you have to check between now and then.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

And yet a wide array of recent polls shows that, especially among white voters, education remains the most important dividing line in reaction to Trump’s handling of the crisis.\\nThat pattern, in turn, signals that most voters are basing their assessments of Trump’s performance less on their actual daily experiences and more on their preexisting viewpoints about his tumultuous and norm-shattering presidency. The biggest exception to that dynamic is older Americans, including older white voters, who polls suggest have clearly cooled on Trump as he and other Republicans have signaled— or flat out declared —that more deaths among seniors might be an acceptable price for reopening the economy.\\nBut mostly, the intense pressure of the pandemic appears to be fortifying, rather than fracturing, the long-standing divisions in the electorate that Trump has already widened since 2016, according to a wide range of previously unpublished polling data provided to The Atlantic.\\n“I think, generally, the last two months have been a good reminder that most people made up their minds about Donald Trump a long time ago, and nothing is going to change their opinion,” says the GOP consultant Alex Conant, a founding partner at Firehouse Strategies and the communications director for Senator Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign. “If they like him, everything he does just affirms why they like him, and if they don’t like him, everything he does reaffirms why they don’t like him.”\\nRead: The voters Trump needs most right now\\nThis dynamic is most clearly apparent when looking at the combined impact of race, education, and gender in driving views about the pandemic and the 2020 race between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nAmong white voters, the pattern for decades has been that men generally vote more Republican than women, while voters with at least a four-year college degree lean more toward Democrats than those without advanced education. The two antithetical poles of opinion: White men without a college degree consistently lean toward the GOP; white women with a college degree typically favor Democrats, with that tilt intensifying under Trump.\\nEvery data source on the 2016 election, such as the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations, showed Trump winning those men by enormous margins while losing the women by varying amounts depending on the survey. In the 2018 House elections, blue-collar white men backed Republican candidates by about two to one, according to the exit polls , while college-educated white women gave Democrats a 20-percentage-point edge, by far the largest margin among those voters that the surveys have ever recorded.\\nThe two groups quickly retreated to their respective corners during the coronavirus crisis. In last week’s national CNN poll , two-thirds of white men without a college degree said they approved of Trump’s handling of the outbreak, according to figures provided by the CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. In surveys from April 28 through May 18, the daily Navigator tracking poll , run by two Democratic polling firms, found that about three-fifths of these men approved of Trump’s response. By contrast, in both the CNN and Navigator polls, 56 percent of college-educated white women disapproved of Trump’s performance.\\nThat gap applies to other recent measures of voter sentiment about the pandemic. While 55 percent of blue-collar men said in the CNN poll that they are comfortable returning to their normal routines, 68 percent of college-educated white women said they are not. In a Monmouth University poll released earlier this month, twice as many non-college-educated white men said Trump is providing helpful, rather than harmful, information on the virus; college-educated white women were more than three times as likely to say that his information was harmful rather than helpful, according to detailed results provided by the poll director Patrick Murray.\\nThe white voters who are more up for grabs for both parties are non-college-educated women and college-educated men. In their response to the outbreak, these two groups offer a striking contrast—one that underscores the durability of the nation’s partisan chasm.\\nAccording to the exit polls, Republicans have carried both blocs in each presidential election since 2000. All the major data sources about the 2016 results— including a study using voting records by the Pew Research Center and an analysis of voter data by the Democratic voter-targeting firm Catalist—found that Trump won non-college-educated white women by at least 20 percentage points. The exit polls and Catalist showed Trump winning college-educated white men by about a dozen points (while Pew showed a narrow win for Hillary Clinton among them).\\nPerhaps not surprisingly, non-college-educated white women exhibit more strain over the outbreak than college-educated white men. In the Navigator polling, these women were considerably more likely to say that they worry about falling behind on bills. And while a slight majority of the men in the CNN survey said they are comfortable returning to their routines, three-fifths of the women said they are not.\\nRead: An unprecedented divide between red and blue America\\nEconomic and public-opinion analysts told me that those differences reflect the widely varying circumstances of the two groups before and during the outbreak: Women without a college degree always express elevated levels of financial pressure, and they are less likely than college-educated men to hold jobs that allow them to work from home. Many of these women also face a greater burden in caring for young children or aging parents.\\nWomen, particularly those without college degrees, feel “the economic impact and also the caregiving burden … pretty acutely,” said Margie Omero, a pollster at the Democratic firm GBAO Strategies, which helps conduct the Navigator poll. “It’s not just about kids at home … It is also taking care of family members, worrying about visiting sick family members, a lot of the tough decisions that people are going to have to make about parents.”\\nAnd yet while these women report more unease over the pandemic, they are more likely than the men to praise Trump’s response to it. In the Navigator polling, 56 percent of the women said they approved of Trump’s handling of the outbreak, compared with just 44 percent of the men. (The gap was smaller in the CNN poll, but the women were still more supportive.) In yesterday’s Quinnipiac University national survey , non-college-educated white women were much less likely than the college-educated men to say that Trump has not done enough to respond. In the early May Monmouth survey, a solid plurality of these women said Trump has provided mostly helpful information on the pandemic; among the men, twice as many said his information has been harmful rather than helpful.\\nThat last result may offer a clue to unlocking the broader trend—that education trumps gender in shaping attitudes about the president’s performance. Operatives in both parties believe that Trump’s volatile and often-erratic pronouncements about the outbreak—such as suggesting the use of bleach and ultraviolet light to treat patients, and announcing that he is taking hydroxychloroquine—have compounded existing doubts among many well-educated white voters about his fitness for the presidency.\\n“There’s no question that Trump himself has reinforced the skepticism of what the people who did not like him … did not like about him before all of this,” said one GOP strategist, who requested anonymity to discuss Trump’s performance. “Now that’s on—to use another wonder drug—steroids.”\\nAll of these attitudes appear to be sifting into the 2020 presidential race in familiar patterns.\\nThe Monmouth survey this month, the NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll last month, and the Quinnipiac poll this week all showed Trump winning nearly two-thirds of non-college-educated white men and Biden capturing just less than two-thirds of college-educated white women.\\nDavid Frum: Trump has lost the plot\\nCompared with Trump’s 2016 performance, the 2018 exit polls generally showed the GOP suffering some erosion among blue-collar white women, with the party’s advantage slipping to 14 percentage points. The latest round of surveys suggests that, among those women, Trump has stabilized at that diminished level, leading by roughly a dozen points (or slightly less) among them . (Only the latest Monmouth poll showed Trump nearing his 2016 margin, with a 23-percentage-point advantage.) Recent state polls in the key Rust Belt battlegrounds have shown more favorable trends for Democrats: Fox News surveys last month in Pennsylvania and Michigan put Biden even among non-college-educated white women, and he led Trump among them in the latest Marquette University Law School poll in Wisconsin.\\nTrump is facing a tougher situation with college-educated white men. The 2018 exit polls showed the GOP maintaining a narrow lead among them in the national House races. But now most of the national surveys show them dividing almost exactly in half between the two candidates. Biden leads narrowly with them in the latest Wisconsin survey, trails narrowly in the Pennsylvania poll, and runs further behind in the Michigan poll. This week’s latest Arizona poll , from the nonpartisan survey firm OH Predictive Insights, also gave Biden a narrow lead with them.\\nAmong nonwhite voters, gender, not education, remains the key divide. In 2016, Clinton won about four-fifths of nonwhite women with or without a college degree, and about two-thirds of the men in both groups, according to previously unpublished results provided by Edison Research. Most preelection polls don’t have a large enough sample to analyze minority voters in such detail, but the huge Nationscape project , managed by UCLA and the Voter Study Group, does. A compilation of its results from April 23 through May 13 show Trump again running slightly better among nonwhite men than women at each level of education. The latest CNN poll showed nonwhite men giving Trump higher ratings than nonwhite women did on both the outbreak and his overall performance.\\nTaken together, all these results testify to the persistence of the country’s underlying fissures, which even an event as universal and wrenching as the outbreak does not appear to have materially changed. Voters’ experiences during the crisis may be shaping their preferences about the November election much less than the ideological and cultural inclinations they brought into it.\\n“It is reinforcing what many people already think,” says the longtime Republican pollster Glen Bolger. “It’s not to say that nobody is experiencing it through their experience with the pandemic, but the majority are filtering it through their perception about Trump.”\\nMichael Steinberger: Why no one is calling on Trump to resign\\nThough that consistency remains the dominant pattern in polling through the crisis, two possible exceptions could tip the 2020 race at a time when the country remains closely divided. Though the outbreak is spreading more broadly into Trump’s rural and small-town base, it has hit hardest in the big-city areas that were most skeptical of him from the outset. That could widen Trump’s deficit in the most populous communities— he already lost America’s 100 largest counties by a combined total of about 15 million votes in 2016—and force him to squeeze even greater margins and higher turnout from smaller places.\\nThe second trend complicates the first for him: As I mentioned before, polling shows that the voting bloc that has most clearly moved away from Trump during the outbreak is older voters, including older whites. Generally, small-town America is not only redder but also grayer. If Trump slips at all with older voters, he will struggle to expand his margins in smaller communities.\\nIt’s remarkable how the outbreak has disrupted every aspect of American life without hugely reconfiguring the landscape for the 2020 presidential race. But to the extent that it has shifted the terrain, it has left Trump facing an even narrower path to a second term. And on that bumpy road, no rock looms before Trump more ominously than the persistent recoil from his values and performance among college-educated white voters of both genders.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Yet in Hulu’s historical satire The Great, Emperor Peter III (played by Nicholas Hoult) appears untroubled. Surrounded by the comforts of royalty and the support of eager-to-please advisers, he treats the war as a nuisance, governing as a chore, and news of unrest as annoying falsehoods. As he and his subjects claim, all is bliss in the court of Peter III. When his new wife, Catherine (Elle Fanning), doesn’t approve of his lifestyle, he brushes her off with a casual retort: “It is hell to dwell.”\\nTruth has been similarly unwelcomed by today’s American leadership. False claims downplaying the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and suggesting a swift end to the crisis have dominated Donald Trump’s press conferences . Before states put social-distancing measures in place, he assured the nation that the virus would disappear, “like a miracle.” When it became evident that it wouldn’t, he suggested nonsensical fixes, such as injecting disinfectant into bodies as a cure. This week, he revealed that he’s been taking hydroxychloroquine , the antimalarial drug medical experts have warned people against using because of its dangerous side effects. Trump has treated facts as inconvenient, rejecting them in favor of minimizing the coronavirus’s impact.\\nThroughout The Great, the black comedy’s satirical tone captures how theatrical and nearsighted politics can become amid a crisis. Peter’s and his allies’ denial of the truth—a deeply distressing truth, involving hundreds of thousands of lives lost—resembles the Trump administration’s shunning of medical expertise. Ignorance paves the way for Peter III’s precious bliss; the president prefers to diminish the threat of the pandemic rather than confront the reality of its consequences. For Peter, ruling is a spectacle, not a duty. In the White House, briefings meant to inform the public have been molded into sales pitches and opportunities for the president to boast about his ratings. Peter’s court may be an exaggeration of real-life Russian politics in the 18th century, but the character’s foolish governing strategy in the face of disaster reflects Trump’s. Both men depend on the appeal of denial and ignorance.\\nTheirs is a leadership style that, during an unprecedented global disaster, has endured because the message it spreads—that nothing is wrong and all is bliss—is enticing. The Great doesn’t spend much time outside of the palace gates to observe the full effects of the Russo-Swedish War, but the series makes clear that Peter’s advisers aid in his oblivion, looking the other way to stay in Peter’s good graces and retain their own high-status lifestyles. The White House has found help from Trump’s base: Many of his supporters, who want their life to return to “normal,” free of the restrictions implemented during lockdown, have launched protests and flouted social-distancing guidelines. When the facts of a crisis are too troublesome to bear, overlooking them in favor of maintaining the status quo can be tempting for those who run a statistically smaller risk of being directly affected in the first place.\\nCreated by Tony McNamara, a co-writer of The Favourite, and based on his 2008 play, The Great best captures this compulsion through the well-educated, sophisticated, and idealistic heroine Catherine, who, despite her role as the audience surrogate, falls under the same spell. When she arrives in Russia from Prussia, she sees the court for what it is—an extravagant, vodka-soaked bubble insulated from horror—and plans a coup while pretending to support her husband. But the more time she spends as empress, the more she conforms to and delights in the world around her. She engages in petty squabbles with the women at court, accepts gifts from Peter (including a meeting with the French philosopher Voltaire, whom she admires), and falls in love with the man Peter offers to be her lover. Midway through the season, she gets a chance to stage her coup earlier than planned, but at the last minute can’t follow through. “You criticize him for inaction,” scoffs her servant and ally, Marial (Phoebe Fox), “but you are just the same.”\\nCatherine isn’t the only one to blame for her paralysis, however. The Great wryly observes how rhetoric plays a role in causing people to avoid unpleasant facts: When Peter does acknowledge the war, he speaks of the conflict as a chance to promote Russia’s glory and earn bragging rights if Russia wins—just as Trump has positioned America as the front-runner in testing for the coronavirus. (The country’s capacity is “unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close,” he erroneously boasted last week. ) The reality is dire for both: Russia has lost 180,000 men to an aimless war, and America counts more than 1.5 million infected .\\nLike the protesters who have reframed social-distancing restrictions as anti-American, the Archbishop (Adam Godley) twists Catherine’s original message—that her new home should be more open-minded to Western ideals—into a selfish and sanctimonious one. Hardship helps the Russian people, he argues, and death is inevitable anyway, an assertion that should sound familiar to anyone who’s heard elected officials asking older, at-risk Americans to sacrifice themselves to save the economy. “People underestimate the joy in suffering,” the Archbishop explains to Catherine. “Walk through the pain, and on the other side, joy and purity.” Ignorance and inaction, in this sense, mutate into necessities for the good of the people.\\nOf course, such a call for endurance is easy for people like the Archbishop, who live in luxury at court, and the anti-social-distancing protesters, who are largely white and can afford to ignore the risk . In both cases, nationalism outweighs the dangers of the crisis. The might of Russia must prevail at all costs; America’s economy should not suffer just because lives are being lost. The Great, for all its outrageous humor, recognizes the disturbing allure of such thinking. McNamara—along with Fanning and Hoult, whose fine-tuned performances turn Peter and Catherine’s contentious relationship into a complex frenemy-ship—focuses on how power, and the comfort that comes with it, can corrupt them both. By the end of the season, the audience roots for Catherine not because she’s well intentioned, but because she recognizes her privilege, grapples with her shortcomings, and reckons with how her circumstances shape her worldview.\\n“I’m fond of you,” Catherine admits to Peter in the finale, just before she begins her coup. “In some ways, you break my heart.” In her hand, she grasps the knife she plans to plunge into his neck. He, not noticing anything, smiles warmly at her. Therein lies a truth that The Great illustrates so well: Bliss founded in ignorance, as Peter is about to learn, is only borrowed bliss.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Williamson / The Washington Post / Getty\\nLink Copied\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has eviscerated state and local finances. The country’s roughly 90,000 nonfederal-government entities provide and pay for most of the government services that Americans receive. Factor out federal defense spending and the federal government’s contributions to health care, and state and local governments do most of the government spending too: $4 trillion worth , or more than one-fifth of America’s gross domestic product.\\nState and local governments lay the groundwork for prosperity, often literally—building roads and airports, courts and schools. Those they employ or contract—including police officers, firefighters, teachers, health-care workers, garbage collectors, and building inspectors—make the rest of the economy hum.\\nBut the dollars that state and local governments rely on to support public services are withering. Closed shops and offices, empty streets, and the obliteration of the travel and entertainment industries threaten nearly every source of state and local revenue. Talk to state and local officials, and those who serve and study them, and you’ll soon discover that they’re preparing for a grim triage of services.\\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher. The loss of essential services hurts a community’s health, safety, and quality of life. It is also politically dangerous. When governments fail to protect their constituents during a pandemic and cut back on social services in its aftermath, they can sour their constituents on democracy and help fuel political extremism.\\nGeorge Packer: We are living in a failed state\\nGovernment and think-tank estimates project total losses in state and local revenue at 15 to 45 percent, shaving up to $1.75 trillion a year from the most essential things governments do. A survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities found that nine out of 10 American cities plan to make deep cuts to their budgets and services. Half of those will need to make last-resort cuts to their police and fire departments.\\nPublic schools are overwhelmingly dependent on state and local revenue. If the estimates that school-district revenues across the nation will drop by an average of 15 percent or more prove right, the country would likely lose one in 12 teachers. In the worst-hit states, one in five may go.The speed with which this crisis has hit local economies exceeds that of even the Great Depression.\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump have been openly skeptical about approving aid to plug these holes, but congressional proposals to provide $200 billion are gaining bipartisan support. House Democrats are mulling $1 trillion in aid. But even that eye-popping number may be unequal to the scope of the crisis, which could leave state and local governments struggling for years.\\n“The crisis started to really hit me in February, when we started to talk to the local hospitals,” Paige Cognetti told me. Cognetti became the mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, in January, after she was elected to replace a mayor headed to prison for bribery and extortion. “By early March, it was clear that we wouldn’t have our big Saint Patrick’s Day parade. That usually brings in a lot of money for businesses in town, and it struck me then that this crisis would affect us for a long time and hit city services. A lot of things keyed off of that decision.”\\nCognetti soon closed city hall to the public. “We looked objectively at what it takes to run a city. We decided to keep police and fire whole in order to keep everyone safe, and to move everything else online.” She furloughed 43 of 600 city workers, making Scranton one of the first municipalities in the country to take that step in the current crisis. “I took a lot of heat for that, but again, we were looking at the absolute necessities ... police, fire, public works, and garbage. If garbage piles up, people panic.” Cognetti holds town-hall meetings twice a week on Facebook Live. “It really doesn’t cost anything. For $5 a week, we can communicate with the community.” She said the city has not released any revenue or spending projections, because there’s still too much uncertainty.\\nLawrence Gostin and Sarah Wetter: Why there’s no national lockdown\\n“The economic health of a community determines its resilience,” Michael Nadol, a former deputy mayor of Philadelphia, explained to me. Now a consultant, he has played the role of receiver for municipalities that get in such deep financial trouble that the courts appoint an expert outsider to steer their finances. “The worst-hit communities are those up against it already. It’s parallel to who’s suffering from the virus. The vulnerable places with vulnerable populations suffer most.” Nadol said that mid-size cities, many of which have big-city challenges without big-city revenues, will be among those that suffer the most in the near term. Over time, the pain will spread wider and deeper.\\nThe fiscal crisis is building just as most cities in America are creating and adopting their budgets for the coming fiscal year. No one knows what revenues will look like, or whether federal aid will materialize. In a normal year, federal aid accounts for only a quarter of the trillions that state and local entities spend. The rest comes from whatever state and local sources they tap to fill their coffers. Most communities in the United States rely on a mix dominated by local property taxes, state income taxes, sales taxes, and fees. All these sources are falling short.\\nAbout two-thirds of all locally collected revenue—as opposed to funds collected by the state and passed on to local governments—comes from property taxes. Before this crisis, property taxes raised $500 billion for local use, funding services including schools, police departments, and fire departments. For now, in the early stages of the pandemic, property taxes remain one of the most stable sources of revenue. But they are a time bomb that may demolish many budgets in a year or two.\\nMichael Pagano, of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago, studies local governments in financial crises. He told me that property taxes are paid at rates determined one to three years before the tax is paid, cushioning the impact for now. “Governments more dependent on property tax have more time to adapt to the crisis,” he said. But Pagano warns that if this crisis runs long enough, large numbers of property owners who are in trouble may not be able to pay their property taxes.\\nMore than 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment , and many others have seen their income decline. Households are paring back expenses to daily essentials and deferring payments on rent, mortgages, and taxes. When citizens stop paying property taxes, local governments can force tax-foreclosure sales of the delinquent property. But when the pain is this widespread, that can compound the underlying problem, forcing governments to provide for the residents they’ve left homeless and to pay for the upkeep of property they can’t sell, and driving down the tax value of surrounding properties. Detroit’s Wayne County, anticipating a wave of delinquency, has temporarily suspended tax sales and evictions.\\nPagano added that property values in some parts of the country are already sinking—which will eventually depress assessments and revenues as well. Property taxes may be the most stable source of local revenue, yet in a prolonged crisis, they get shaky too.\\nHow about nonfederal income taxes? They provide about $400 billion in state and local revenue. With high unemployment and salaries getting shaved, the size of the hole here is uncertain, but undoubtedly huge.\\nRead: A national sales tax?\\nSales taxes ? Retail sales account for about 70 percent of all economic activity in the U.S., and before the crisis, the sales tax on purchases delivered about $600 billion to state and local governments. Retail sales dropped by 16.4 percent last month , on top of an 8.3 percent hit in March, but state and local sales-tax receipts can drop by disproportionally greater amounts. One reason is that essential goods, such as food and drugs, and services such as health care are often minimally taxed. U.S. Census Bureau estimates suggest that sales-tax receipts in the U.S. could drop by 25 percent .\\nRoad taxes have hit the skids too. The nonfederal share of fuel taxes pays for half of states’ road-related costs, $40 billion worth. Overall, traffic and fuel consumption are down 20 to 30 percent, and in cities as much as 40 percent . So are the related revenues.\\nPeople are drinking more, so how about liquor taxes? In the state and local tax cocktail, they’re just bitters, accounting for $10 billion. Capital-gains taxes? Most investors lost money in the market swoon. Airport taxes and gate fees? Hotel and entertainment taxes? Stadium revenue? These old, reliable sources of revenue won’t deliver much money right now.\\nMunicipalities that relied on travel and entertainment are in a particular bind. “We’re somewhat unique in Sandusky,” says Eric Wobser, the city manager of the Ohio town of 25,000 on Lake Erie. “We’re a smaller town with an influx of 10 million visitors every year who come for Cedar Point [an amusement park] and water amenities. A disproportionate amount of our revenue is seasonal.” A lengthy closing of Cedar Point would slash 45 percent from Sandusky’s city budget, mostly due to lost sales taxes and other tourism-related sources. “On March 16, when our governor announced the state would close restaurants and then schools, I thought it would be a few-weeks thing. In Sandusky, we were planning to announce our big plans for the 150th anniversary of Cedar Point. When I realized the park could not open, I saw that the rest of our economy would shut down. We will be one of the most affected communities, per capita, in the country.”\\nAfter the Great Recession in 2008, communities across America learned that they needed big rainy-day reserves for when disaster struck. In early March, such reserves overall were at all-time highs, and communities generally had money to run for 30 days following a shock. Sandusky put aside $5.2 million to cushion against a hit to its $24 million annual budget. But Sandusky, like all other places with such reserves, didn’t plan for anything like the present reality. “We thought we were in healthy condition. We had lowered our debt, raised our taxes, built reserves. We planned new infrastructure and created a $2.3 million fund to improve century-old, out-of-code local housing,” Wobser told me.\\nThose improvements were shelved indefinitely. “Now we’ve already cut 10 percent from our budget, eliminated positions,” Wobser said. “So far, we’ve avoided cutting public-safety personnel, but the next round of cuts will impact that. And we’ll deficit spend this year and next. It’s devastating. We’ll be reducing police and fire. The city is not so property-tax dependent, but the schools and libraries are.”\\nDerek Thompson: We can prevent a Great Depression. It’ll take $10 trillion.\\nWobser said those will take big hits too, given that “most of the city’s revenue sources will be zero.” Like a lot of older cities, Sandusky is adjacent to newer communities that have drawn away its revenue sources. “There are a lot of unincorporated areas where our middle class and retail went to. They took from us and their needs are not the same.” Wobser hopes that if more federal relief comes, it takes into account the deeper needs of legacy cities, with their vulnerable populations. “We need something that’s redistributive,” he said.\\nSandusky may be unique as a tourist destination in Ohio, but entire states, including Florida, Nevada, and Hawaii, have built their economy around tourism . They tend to favor policies that keep taxes and services low in comparison with other states. Low taxes make them especially attractive to retirees, who bring their savings with them. Now these states’ economies are hit hard.\\nIn Nevada, one in four jobs is in leisure and hospitality. Las Vegas suffered some of the worst job losses in the country, as the pandemic hit, and all but went dark. Three-quarters of the state’s population lives in Clark County, which expects its municipal budget to be cut in half, with sharp reductions in services, including public safety, health care, and education.\\nFlorida raises more than 70 percent of its revenue through sales taxes, and tourists typically pay 20 percent of the total. But tourism is wrecked, and the state’s own shoppers are stuck at home. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has promised no consequential cuts to services. But that’s happy talk in a state that already struggles to deliver the services its citizens need. Florida’s dysfunctional unemployment system lacks the resources necessary to deliver federal money to hundreds of thousands of jobless workers.\\nThe ratings agency Moody’s forecasts that Florida will suffer a budget shortfall of $6.5 billion to $10 billion. That will be compounded by $1.74 billion in coronavirus-related Medicaid expenses. Add that up, and the state budget may be facing a 25 percent hole. And that’s just the state’s revenues; localities will have their own large losses . “We’re trying to find 127 million tourists to have the confidence to come back and patronize our state,” Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s chief financial officer, said recently. “This is a one-of-a-kind enemy that we’ve never seen before.”\\nRead: I just flew. It was worse than I thought it would be.\\nFlorida faces some unique challenges, but the general picture holds true elsewhere as well. “We expect our revenue sources to fall off a cliff,” Jorge Elorza, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, told me. “We don’t know what’s around the corner, except that it’s uncertainty atop uncertainty.” Providence relies heavily on property taxes, he said. The city can get through the short term without drastic action, but “as the city puts together its next budget, it will need to have an extremely painful discussion.”\\nElorza expects cities to face compounding problems, as needs increase and revenues decline. “At the city level, we bear the brunt of the burden to help people,” he said. “If people are being foreclosed on and lose their home, they turn to their cities for support. But that need now is coming when the cities are most strapped. If there are deficiencies at any other level, we at the local level have to try to fill the void.”\\nEven communities on the firmest fiscal footing face trouble ahead. Montgomery County, Maryland, profits from its proximity to Washington, D.C. “We have a robust tax structure with our combination of income tax and property tax,” the county’s budget director, Richard Madaleno, told me. “We’re in a vibrant community with wealth; we have a 10 percent budget reserve of $500 million and a fully funded retirement system.” Madaleno said that the county is budgeting for a 15 percent unemployment rate. In the short term, that will be cushioned by Congress’s addition of $600 each week to individual unemployment checks and 13 weeks to the coverage. But a large proportion of local services, including education, are paid for by state sales taxes, which, Madaleno said, are in a “medically induced coma.”\\nAs the crisis extends, not even a big new federal package of aid for states and localities can rescue the county from deep cuts. “Just as the economy starts to wake up,” Madaleno said, “we will have another wave of disaster as state and local governments start cutting back, especially on things like infrastructure projects that provide jobs that are critical to weathering a downturn. We’re not like a family. We cannot tighten our belts. We have to organize [COVID-19] testing, do contact tracing, and everything else. We need to spend more in a crisis as our revenue goes down.”\\nBudgeting puts a lot of pressure on state and local governments under any circumstance, but it is particularly hard when elected officials, administrators, and citizens need to connect remotely. The mayors and city managers I talked with have worked to move meetings online. But efforts to engage local communities in the hardest decisions their governments will ever have to make have run headlong into the confusion and desperation of ordinary Americans.\\nDavid Frum: Why Mitch McConnell wants states to go bankrupt\\n“I did a town-hall meeting with a news station,” Elorza said. “We invited the public to call in, and the overwhelming number of questions to me were from people wondering where their stimulus check was.” That’s an urgent question, but one that local officials aren’t able to address.\\nThe problem is compounded by the collapse of local news outlets during the pandemic, as advertising has evaporated. Penny Abernathy, of the University of North Carolina, keeps track of the local-news business. By her count, the United States has 5,500 small dailies and weeklies and nearly 150 state and regional papers. “The bulk of both the loss in circulation and the loss in journalists has occurred at the state and regional level,” Abernathy told me. “So that has wiped out all of those critical beats that we used to rely on, whether … it was [health], political coverage of the state, all the great investigative work … And then on the local level … what’s been wiped out is, you no longer have someone showing up for the routine government meetings, like the school board.”\\nThe shift to digital meetings and the disappearance of local news coverage are widening the gap between the affluent, highly educated, engaged voters who are able to make local governments respond to their desires and the rest of the population, who have greater needs but less leverage. “People can log in to public meetings from home,” Elorza said. “We will continue to invest in that. But I am concerned less about the technology than about the equity and how we can support people without high-speed internet.” And a similar divide is visible among municipalities. “Larger cities have the resources to use tech better; smaller ones do not.”\\n“It’s very difficult to get citizens involved by Zoom,” said Madaleno, whose county is among the best educated in the U.S. “In prior years, the budget hearings were full of teachers, parents, etc. wearing T-shirts, holding signs. Now all of that has disappeared. You can sit at home and watch people deliberate, but that’s not the in-person aspect that’s critical to democracy. It’s one-way, and it’s more true on the local level.” There are certain people in every community “who have the officials’ cellphone numbers and who can get someone on the phone,” Madaleno added, but “a hearing is for everybody.”\\nWhen crises hit and the public demands action, executives often gain new powers. New York State’s legislature, for example, ceded Governor Andrew Cuomo unilateral authority to make cuts to the budget for up to one year.\\nThat extraordinary authority demands robust oversight to guard against self-dealing, corruption, and incompetence—and it requires democratic feedback and participation to ensure that government remains responsive to the needs of its constituents. But all too often, that’s not what happens.\\n“We seldom have leaders as wise, accurate, and just as we wish,” Archon Fung, a professor of citizenship and self-government at Harvard, wrote in the Boston Review , but democratic engagement can check their power and compel them to serve us better. Relinquishing the process of democratic deliberation in favor of centralized authority, he argued, means surrendering citizens’ orientation “toward the common good [and to] do their part to make society work well.”\\nRead: America’s patchwork pandemic is fraying even further\\nCognetti, Elorza, and other mayors are betting on the potential of technology to draw citizens into the process of governance. Perhaps with enough outreach and education, technology can increase citizen participation—-and passion.\\nBut in the current crisis, it was the small number of camo-wearing, assault-rifle-toting protesters in Michigan who most effectively made their presence felt. President Trump insisted that the Michigan protesters were “ very good people ”; the threat they posed led to the abrupt cancellation of the state’s legislative session.\\nSuch protests remain exceptional, but they point in a worrisome direction. “There is a rough consensus in political science that governments in crisis tend to veer toward the extreme right and authoritarianism,” the Northwestern University political scientist Jeffrey Winters told me.\\nKristian Blickle, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, studied Germany in the grip of the influenza pandemic, from 1918 to 1920. He found that the German cities where the most people died spent the least per capita on their inhabitants in the years just after the pandemic. These were also the places where right-wing-extremist parties did especially well in elections a decade later. His findings, Blickle wrote, show “that pandemics may not only affect the provision of public goods, but that they may have a direct effect on extremist voting.”\\nIf Blickle’s study has lessons for states and localities facing deep cuts to revenue and services now, one might be that democracy is best maintained when governments have the capacity to serve their constituents. That would seem to argue for a federal aid package big enough to save state and local governments from making the deepest cuts now—and capable of fending off the rise of extremism.\\nBut any such package would have to make its way through the U.S. Senate, where Mitch McConnell has already expressed his skepticism. “One possible way to understand Mitch McConnell’s reluctance to offer aid that he believes will overly favor so-called blue states,” Winters said, “is that the right is worried about what the big federal relief packages Congress has already passed show, namely that big government can redistribute wealth and improve lives. And that Americans have the power, through our government, to make such giant redistributions happen.”\\nFor now, state and local governments face a worrying mix, with revenues in steep decline, expenses skyrocketing, oversight disappearing, and democratic participation dropping. If they’re going to meet the needs of their people and bolster public faith in the democratic experiment, they’re going to need help from the federal government—and greater engagement from their constituents.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Kennedy proposed significant civil-rights legislation. In response, the word, which had primarily denoted the recoil of a fishing line, was repurposed, usually as “white backlash,” to refer to opposition to the increased pace of African American civil-rights activism or the Kennedy (and, after his assassination in November 1963, the Lyndon B. Johnson) administration’s legislative proposals and executive actions, or both.\\nIn 1966, a commentator, speaking of “the grand new word, backlash,” claimed without much exaggeration that “just about everything that happened could be (and was) attributed to some form of backlash.” The word came to stand for a topsy-turvy rebellion in which white people with relative societal power perceived themselves as victimized by what they described as overly aggressive African Americans demanding equal rights. Backlash, as the New York Times columnist Tom Wicker wrote , “is nothing more nor less than white resentment of Negroes.”\\nMoving beyond an opposition to civil rights, the word backlash—less frequently qualified as “white”—quickly became a synonym for a new and growing conservative force, signifying a virulent counterreaction to all manner of social movements and cultural transformations that became central to American politics. Over time, observers noted manifestations of this reaction in a “ Southern backlash ,” a “ male backlash ,” a “ heterosexual backlash ,” a “ property tax backlash ” and a “ backlash against environmentalists .” Just a month after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, a journalist described the United States as being in the midst of “a multitude of backlashes.” But as one commentator pointed out , “The word which gave rise to all sorts of other ‘lashes’ was coined in reference to white opposition to Negro gains.”\\nBacklash may have burst onto the scene as “ the word of the year in American politics ” in 1964, but it described one of the oldest and deepest patterns in American politics, one that is once again playing out today in the right-wing campaign against social distancing. Backlashes appear as seemingly serial and discrete events—against the civil-rights movement in the 1960s, or the women’s movement in the ’70s, or the gay-rights movement in the ’90s. But this obscures an underlying continuity: These individual backlashes are all instances of a reactionary tradition, one that is deeply woven into American political culture and that extends back to the era of Reconstruction, at least. And the backlashes are powerful not only for the fury they represent, but in the fear they instill in political leaders, even progressives, who hesitate to push things “too far.”\\nDuring Reconstruction, opponents of the black-freedom struggle deployed preemptive, apocalyptic, slippery-slope arguments that have remained enduring features of backlash politics up to the present. They treated federal support for African American civil rights, economic and social equality—however delayed, reluctant, underfunded, and incomplete it may have been—as a cataclysmic overreaction and framed it as a far more dangerous threat to liberty than the injustice it was designed to address. In 1867, not even two years after ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle decried the placement of political power “in the hands of a property-less and ignorant class of the population,” and pronounced that “the pending Reconstruction scheme must be abandoned.”\\nSince then, such framing has done more than merely shape the politics of reaction in the United States; it has also constrained putatively supportive political leaders, who live in fear of setting off backlashes. Responding to a moderate plan to enfranchise only free blacks in Louisiana in 1864, the Union general Nathaniel P. Banks, worrying about a negative response from the state’s whites, who were being defeated in the Civil War, said , “Revolutions which are not controlled and held within reasonable limits produce counter-revolution.” That obeisance to a defeated group in 1864 was an extreme version of a general pattern that has remained a hallmark of backlashes ever since: solicitousness to white fears.\\nFor many white backlashers in the 1960s, the era of what the historian C. Vann Woodward called the “second Reconstruction,” the first Reconstruction remained a negative model. They viewed its reform as overly fast-paced, and felt that it foregrounded black civil rights at the cost of white people’s peace of mind. They associated civil-rights activism with what popular historians and commentators of the day called the “ excesses ” of Reconstruction, by which they meant a combination of “militant” African American demands for basic equality with overweening, aggressive, and hasty federal action in support of interracial democracy. Thurman Sensing of the Southern States Industrial Council, a conservative business group, described the civil-rights movement in 1966 as an effort to force “the Reconstruction of American customs,” showing the degree to which the post–Civil War campaign for racial equality remained a central metaphor for white backlashers. The journalist in December 1963 who noted the political power of those opposed to “Negro pressure for equal opportunity and the Federal Government’s pace on the Civil Rights front,” could just as easily have been describing the origins of the counterrevolution of the 1870s.\\nThere was, then, nothing particularly novel about the constituent elements of white backlash to the civil-rights movement: its smoldering resentment, its belief that the movement was proceeding “too fast,” its demands for emotional and psychological sympathy, and its displacement of African Americans’ struggles with its own claims of grievance.\\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that the white backlash in this case was in place before the passage of the Civil Rights Act in July 1964. The pattern is this: American reactionary politics is nearly always preemptive, predicting catastrophe and highlighting potential slippery slopes. “White backlash,” after all, got its name in 1963, just months after African Americans in Birmingham risked attacks from police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses in order to demand justice, and immediately after Kennedy mooted the idea of substantive legislation—both events taking place well before the Civil Rights Act became law. What one reporter called “ white panic ” was driven by fears of “ favoritism ” and “ special privileges ” for African Americans—that white “workers would be forced out of their jobs to make way for Negroes,” as one article put it that year, when Jim Crow still prevailed. “Many of my people think the Negroes want to take over the country,” a midwestern Republican politician said in a Wall Street Journal article published on April 10 of the following year, still months before the Act’s passage. “They think there are things in the bill that just aren’t there, like forced sales of housing to Negroes and stuff like that.” White backlashers imagined coercion where it did not exist. They embraced a lexicon and posture of victimization that hearkened back to the era of Reconstruction and anticipated the deceiving, self-pitying MAGA discourse that drives reactionary politics in Donald Trump’s America.\\nResidents of Levittown, Pennsylvania, are shown during a rally on August 17, 1957, to protest plans by William Myers, a black man, to move into a home in the all-white community of 60,000 people.\\xa0 (Bill Ingraham / AP)\\nSince Reconstruction, many backlash campaigns have imposed a politics of white fragility and frustration onto racial-equality struggles. Reporting on the “hate vote” in The Saturday Evening Post, in October 1964, one month before the presidential election, Ben H. Bagdikian highlighted the “churning, emotional conflict within each voter,” by which he meant white people. He noted that the backlashers “are not against a better life for the Negro, but they are strongly against this being achieved at the cost of white tranquility.” The elevation of “tranquility” over equal justice for all was a hallmark of backlash discourse, which ranked white feelings over black rights.\\nBacklashers understood civil rights as zero-sum, and therefore treated campaigns for African American equality as an inexcusable undermining of what they saw as deserved white privileges and prerogatives. A New York Times poll revealed , in condensed form, the emotional landscape of the white backlash: “Northern white urbanites have no sympathy for the Negro’s plight, and believe the Civil Rights movement has gone too far, while a considerable percentage believes Negroes ‘don’t appreciate what we’re doing for them.’” The extension of sympathy, such as being in favor of a “better life for the Negro,” was, then, conditional on personal convenience and easily withdrawn. “In general, the persons interviewed were mildly in favor of a better break for Negroes—as long as it wouldn’t affect them personally,” the reporter Dave Allbaugh observed in 1963.\\n“Too far. Too fast.” \\xa0Although Kennedy’s proposal came more than 80 years after the last significant piece of civil-rights legislation was passed in 1875, backlashers often spoke in these terms, deputizing themselves as judges of the proper scope and pace of social change. On February 23, 1964, in The Washington Post, the journalist Robert Baker described the backlash as white “resentment of Negro boycotts and dramatic protests” that they had determined to be “ill-advised and unreasonable,” which suggested that white critics should determine the standard for advisable and reasonable protest. They charged African American protesters—who sought to end nearly a century of Jim Crow segregation, lynching, and disenfranchisement, as well as job and housing discrimination—with moving “ too militantly. ” To backlashers, the potential passage of the Civil Rights Act marked the dangerous acceleration of a process that needed to proceed more deliberately, according to their schedule and on their terms. “There is wide agreement on Capitol Hill that the polls are right in saying that the white majority believes that the Negro is pushing too far, too fast and that the Kennedy administration is trying to do too much to help the Negro,” Chalmers M. Roberts of The Washington Post wrote in October 1963, in the first story of a three-part report on “the current status of the racial issue in America.” A few months earlier, in his “ Letter From a Birmingham Jail, ” Martin Luther King Jr. criticized white moderates (“who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation”) on the ground that their charges of excessive haste were a cover for the racist status quo: “For years now I have heard the word ‘Wait!’ It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ‘Wait’ has almost always meant ‘Never.’ We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ‘justice too long delayed is justice denied.’”\\nWhite backlashers did not just wallow in their fear, anger, and resentment. In broadcasting these feelings widely, they shaped the limits of acceptable reform. Recommending a “ go-slow course ,” they could extend sympathy or not, and sought to determine when equal rights crossed the line into “special privileges.” A reporter noted “the apprehension of suburbanites and others in white neighborhoods that their residential areas will face an influx of Negroes.” In this worldview, whites presented themselves as victims, the crimes perpetrated against them by campaigns for equality were anxiety, inconvenience, and fear. Long before the passage of the Civil Rights Act, a politician told the Post’s Roberts in October 1963, “For the first time, I’m getting mail from white people saying, ‘Wait a minute, we’ve got rights too.’” The “too” was especially telling because at that time a large number of African Americans still lacked federal protection for basic civil and voting rights.\\nThe “white backlash” thus produced a politics of displacement, shifting the focus from those denied equality under the law and demanding justice to those who imagined threat or inconvenience in the possibility of social change. In September 1963, the Dayton Daily News highlighted the “Northern whites who are growing increasingly jittery as the wave of Negro protest washes home on their doorstep,” and in November of that same year, the Los Angeles Times noted “the welter of ill-feeling generated by Negro marches and sit-ins.” The feelings that mattered were those of white people.\\nThe reporting on the backlash foregrounded white fears and anxieties in a way that coverage of African Americans rarely did. Jerry Landauer’s April 1964 report for the Wall Street Journal highlighted white people’s “emotion-laden struggle,” appropriating even the word struggle to describe the psychological challenges for white Americans of adjusting to the possibility of racial equality. Landauer noted “the intense resentment of large blocs of whites in the North,” which was amplified by the likelihood that the Civil Rights Act might actually become law (which it did in July). “To them, the bill has become a symbol of fear—fear of losing jobs to Negroes; fear that neighborhood schools will be flooded by Negro kids ‘bussed in’ from across town; fear that homeowners will be forced to sell, if they wish to sell at all, to Negro newcomers.” These were fears of the consequences of African American equality, framed as unfair victimization.\\nThroughout what we might call the “backlash era,” African Americans offered a clear-eyed analysis and robust critique of backlashes and white defenses of them, taking them to be, as the ex-baseball star and longtime activist Jackie Robinson put it in a 1966 New York Amsterdam News article, “a great big fat alibi for bigotry.” Whereas many white observers in the early 1960s highlighted the novelty of white backlash, Martin Luther King Jr. more accurately called it “ a new name for an old phenomenon ” that “ had always existed underneath and sometimes on the surface of American life. ”\\xa0 Langston Hughes wrote a poem, “The Backlash Blues,” which Nina Simone later set to music and recorded.\\nMembers of the Arkansas-based white-pride organization White Revolution protest on May 21, 2005. (David S. Holloway / Getty)\\nPerhaps Lorraine Hansberry most directly put her finger on the issue in a June 1964 talk titled “The Black Revolution and the White Backlash,” which she gave at the Town Hall in New York City. She spoke during an event organized by the Association of Artists for Freedom, a group of African American artists and intellectuals, about two weeks before the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Pointing to the long history of the black-liberation struggle, Hansberry said, “The charge of impatience is simply unbearable.” Her request to the “white liberal to stop being a liberal and to become a radical” was largely a call for those liberals to recognize that the true victims of racism were not resentful white Americans but African Americans demanding equality.\\nIn the short run, the media spotlight on the white backlash of 1963–64 appeared to have been spectacularly misplaced. The movement proved to be an electoral failure, one almost immediately demonstrated to have been on the wrong side of history. Not only did the Civil Rights Act pass in 1964, but later that year, Lyndon B. Johnson won an overwhelming election victory, leading him to speculate that a “frontlash” of civil-rights support was far more significant than what he labeled the “so-called backlash,” which suffered crushing double defeats that year. Johnson predicted at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City that “for every backlash that the Democrats lose, we pick up three frontlash [votes],” and his shellacking of Barry Goldwater on Election Day seemed to prove him correct.\\nBut, as Johnson was also well aware, the forces of backlash were far from defeated. “I think we just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come,” LBJ told Bill Moyers, his press aide, shortly after he signed the Civil Rights Act. With the hindsight that history offers, we can see that Goldwater’s campaign was less a sign of the backlash’s vanquishing than a harbinger of modern conservatism. In 1966, the influential columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak called white backlash “a permanent feature of the political scene,” where it has remained ever since.\\nUsing the same phrase that General Banks had employed a century earlier, but to different purposes, a columnist wrote that the proper way to understand white backlash was as “a counter-revolution against the black man.” Counterrevolution is a phrase that Americans rarely use to describe our politics. But it is not unfair or inaccurate to apply this label to white backlash, whose explicit goal was to slow or halt the civil-rights revolution.\\nThe backlashers lost a number of key political battles in the 1960s, the decade in which they got their name. From Reconstruction to the New Deal, they had been vanquished before, and they’ve been defeated more recently, too, in a variety of areas—LBGTQ rights, for example. But both before and since, the preemptive politics of grievance and anti-egalitarianism they championed, whereby the psychology of privilege takes center stage while the needs of the oppressed are forced to wait in the wings, has left a deforming and reactionary imprint on our political culture. It has done so not just by emboldening reactionaries but by making the fear of setting off backlashes a standard element of the political conversation.\\nNeo-Nazis, members of the alt-right, and white supremacists take part in a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2019. (Zach D Roberts / NurPhoto via Getty)\\nConsider, as examples, when last year the economist Larry Summers tweeted about the dangers of a wealth tax “boomerang,” and David Brooks warned about the “ugly backlash” that would likely follow an impeachment trial. Or, in a similar vein, when the columnist Ross Douthat wrote that if the Democrats adopt the Green New Deal, it “will empower climate-change skeptics, weaken the hand of would-be compromisers in the GOP” and “possibly help Donald Trump win re-election.” In this way, backlash politics has become a constraint on modern liberalism.\\nBacklash dynamics have played out over and over again through the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st. They appeared in the reaction against the women’s movement—which, as Mary Wiegers wrote in 1970, faced a “built-in backlash” before it even got started—that culminated in the successful campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment as it came close to becoming law. Such dynamics remained central to campaigns against social provisions, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in the 1980s and ’90s, and have been reflected in the genre of “angry white male” movies, including Falling Down and Gran Torino. More recently, and more consequentially, these forces helped elect Donald Trump, who framed his campaign and continues to treat his presidency as a backlash against his predecessor, Barack Obama, the first African American president. \\xa0\\nThe backlashers have been out in force at recent anti-social-distancing protests, which have been dominated by white people proclaiming that public-health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are robbing them of their birthright of liberty. Making the connection to prior backlashes explicit, some protesters have waved Confederate flags and held signs that read Give me liberty or give me death. While in some ways laughable, given their complaints about being unable to get a haircut or having to “ get two iced teas in the drive thru, ” some of the protesters also incite fear, with their ostentatious weapon-wielding and threats of violence, to say nothing of their willingness to potentially infect others with the coronavirus. Drawing upon the template of the backlashes of earlier historic moments, these protesters, too, combine the paranoia and insecurity that have long warped our political culture with acclamations of freedom for some at the expense of freedom for all. As during Reconstruction and the civil-rights era, we face once again the danger that a politics of freedom and equality may be eclipsed by the psychology of white resentment.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

It’s remarkable how determined they remain to defend the swindler, and for how long—and how they try to shift the blame to those who tried to warn them of the swindle. The pain of being seen as a fool hurts more than the loss of money; it’s more important to protect the ego against indignity than to visit justice upon the perpetrator. We human beings so often prefer a lie that affirms us to a truth that challenges us.\\nAmericans are living now through the worst pandemic in a century and the severest economic crisis since the Great Depression. At every turn, President Donald Trump has made the crises worse. Had somebody else been president in December 2019—Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush—fewer Americans would have met untimely deaths; fewer Americans would now be unemployed; fewer businesses would be heading toward bankruptcy.\\nOn the eve of the 2016 election, a Pulitzer Prize–winning columnist opined in The Washington Post: “If Trump wins, he’ll be held more or less in check by the House and Senate, because that’s the way our system of government is set up. Not even Republicans are eager to follow Trump’s lead.”\\nI cite that column—published under the headline “Calm Down. We’ll Be Fine No Matter Who Wins”—not to single it out, but precisely because it was so un-singular. The keepers of the institutions could imagine Trump testing the system. They could not imagine the system failing the test.\\nAnd yet fail it did. The story of the Trump years is a story of institutions that failed. The Department of Justice failed. The inspectors general failed. Congressional oversight failed. The national-security establishment failed. The courts failed. Trump has done things that no previous American president would ever have dared, that no previous president sank low enough even to imagine. Sometimes he was stopped, more often not. But whether stopped or not in any particular case, he has never ceased pressing ahead to do even worse the next time.\\nDavid Frum: This is Trump’s fault\\nThe only check remaining is that of the 2020 ballot box. Not Trump alone, but the great political party behind him, is working to ensure that election is as unfree and unfair as possible. In that effort, they have mobilized the active or tacit support of millions of Americans.\\nThis post was excerpted from Frum’s recent book .\\nTrump is a swindler, but the Trumpocalypse of 2020 represents something a lot bigger and a lot worse than a swindle. In the fall of 2019, a nonpartisan research organization studied the distinctive attitudes of Republicans who watched Fox News as their primary source of information. Among that group, 55 percent said there was virtually nothing President Trump could do that would change their minds about supporting him. Fox News and the Facebook feed have become for many Americans friends more intimate and trusted than family or neighbors. The validation of their prejudices by television and Facebook is a validation of themselves.\\nAnd so, for the sake of flag and faith, millions of decent conservative Americans countenanced scandals, wrongs, disloyalty, and crime. Trump’s followers live in an isolated knowledge community that has developed its own situational ethics. They wanted to lock up Hillary Clinton for sending and receiving emails on a personal server, not caring even slightly when Ivanka Trump did the exact same thing or when Trump outright blabbed to the Russian foreign minister secrets much more vital than anything Clinton could possibly have risked. They plunged into the QAnon fantasy of a wise and good Trump poised to crush a global ring of child molesters, in order to avoid the reality of a malignant Trump who by his own admission had preyed upon teenage beauty-pageant contestants.\\nAnd if Trump’s supporters are not interested in holding him to account, most of the institutions of American government haven’t proved capable of doing so either. The Trump years demonstrated the very great extent to which presidential cooperation with the law is voluntary, especially if he retains a loyal attorney general, and a sufficient blocking vote in Congress.\\nIt’s illegal for federal employees to overspend on travel to benefit themselves or their colleagues. In 2012, a senior executive at the General Services Administration was sentenced to three months in prison, three months under house arrest, and three years’ parole for taking personal side jaunts and overspending on lavish retreats for his staff.\\nYet when Vice President Pence visited Ireland in 2019, he wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars by staying not in Dublin, the site of his meetings, but at Trump’s golf course 180 miles away, on the opposite coast of the island. Pence tried to make things right by paying for his own room, but that only added a direct personal payoff to Trump to the many other ethical breaches of the trip. Any other federal employee who wasted travel expenses in order to direct money to his supervisor would find himself in serious trouble: facing at least a firing, possibly prison time if the behavior was egregious enough. But not Pence. Not the Trump staffers who meet every Tuesday evening with lobbyists at the Trump hotel in Washington, D.C. In the George W. Bush White House, where I once worked, you showed you belonged by wearing cowboy boots; in the Trump White House, by repaying some of your salary back into the boss’s pockets.\\nRead: The president is winning his war on American institutions\\nIt is illegal for government employees to use their positions to engage in certain political activities. They are especially forbidden to engage directly in election campaigns while on the government payroll. The presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway appeared to violate this law—the Hatch Act—so persistently and flagrantly that she triggered an internal investigation. In June 2019, the investigation reported that indeed she had broken the law repeatedly and intentionally.\\nIf Conway had been a career government employee, she would have been dismissed from her position immediately. By courtesy, however, the enforcement of the Hatch Act upon political appointees is left to the president directly. The investigation, therefore, concluded with a recommendation to the president, rather than a direct order, that Conway be subject to “appropriate disciplinary action”: in other words, that she be fired.\\nTrump disregarded the recommendation. Conway mocked the finding to reporters. As one journalist read the recommendation to her, she replied: “Blah, blah, blah. If you’re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it’s not going to work. Let me know when the jail sentence starts.”\\nAt some point in the 2020 campaign, some federal worker will get excited about the election and post something intemperate on Facebook or do something else to infringe the 1939 law. She will be disciplined—fired if the offense is egregious or visible enough—and she will know that this law that applies to her was ignored in the much worse case of a higher-ranked person. Or perhaps in 2020, the law will be extra-scrupulously obeyed by federal workers, precisely because they already know that there is one law for Trump cronies and a different law for everybody else.\\nNo other major democracy operates so political a system of law enforcement as the United States. The 93 U.S. attorneys are all political appointees. They report to an assistant attorney general for the criminal division, also a political appointee. The AAG reports to a deputy attorney general and finally the attorney general—all political. Ideally, while people are appointed to those posts for political reasons, they do not do their jobs in a political way. Americans can be proud that this ideal is so often voluntarily met. But when not voluntarily met, the ideal is difficult to enforce.\\nIn other democracies, the equivalents of the AAG for the criminal division are career civil servants. The British attorney general has no role in the operation of the Crown Prosecution Service. Germany’s general federal prosecutor is even more insulated from politics. Problems arise in these systems too. Justin Trudeau’s government in Canada was rocked by the charge that the prime minister had leaned on prosecutors in that country to go easy on a corporation that had been generous in its campaign contributions to his party. But in those other countries, the brute political pressure that Trump applied via Attorney General William Barr on the Department of Justice is much less likely to have an effect.\\nDonald Ayer: Why Bill Barr is so dangerous\\nAt one point in 2019, Trump simultaneously refused all cooperation with 20 distinct congressional investigations—testing whether there was much Congress could do about it. There proved to be surprisingly little. Congress’s contempt powers lag far behind those of courts. As the Congressional Research Service warned in 2017:\\nA number of obstacles face Congress in any attempt to enforce a subpoena issued against an executive branch official. Although the courts have reaffirmed Congress’s constitutional authority to issue and enforce subpoenas, efforts to punish an executive branch official for non-compliance … will likely prove unavailing in many, if not most, circumstances.\\nEven outright lying to Congress can prove exceptionally difficult to punish. “Almost no one is prosecuted for lying to Congress,” concludes the leading law-review article on the subject. “In fact, only six people have been convicted of perjury or related charges in relation to Congress in the last sixty years.” Those words were published in 2006, but a report by Roll Call in 2018 found they still held true. The pitcher Roger Clemens was indicted for lying to Congress about steroids in 2009. He was acquitted on all charges in 2012. If you’re a Trump executive-branch official, you must like your chances of getting away with lying—or worse.\\nSome wonder: Why doesn’t Congress act? But there is no “Congress.” There are only the two parties in Congress. The members of the two parties cannot even agree on methods of evidence or standards of behavior. Republican Representative Ted Yoho from Florida spoke for troublingly many members of his caucus when he said of a fellow member of Congress that he “works for the president; he answers to the president.” Yoho’s district around Gainesville, Florida, voted 41 percent against Donald Trump in 2016. Those voters are also Yoho’s constituents, but he does not answer to any of them. In his mind, he is a party man first and only.\\nCongress as an institution cannot function on this kind of partisan mentality. There can be no meaningful oversight of the executive branch if the only standards are “Yay, team!” and “Boo, team!” The party of the president should be just as keen as the other party to enforce subpoenas and punish contempt, because both parties in Congress should feel the same concern for the powers of Congress. But of course, that’s not how things work.\\nAlmost all Republicans in the House of Representatives, and the great majority of Republicans in the Senate, will act to defend a president they despise against charges they know to be true. The worst of them will hare after crazy conspiracy theories. Most, though, will voice their concern and then find ways to avoid their duty. The system that protects all of us has failed because the protectors of that system have failed to protect it for us.\\nDemocracy does not fly on autopilot. If the people responsible for the institutions of democracy will not do the job, the job will not be done. While the job goes undone, the United States and the world careen toward conflict and crisis.\\nThis article is excerpted from Frum’s recent book, Trumpocalypse: Restoring American Democracy .\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Graduation is a leap into uncertainty even during ordinary times, and COVID-19 times are far from ordinary. It’s a scary moment to be heading out into the world. But my advice to my son—and to all graduates—remains the same as it would have been without a pandemic: Find your marshmallow.\\nMaybe that sounds like some groovy ’60s code language for dropping acid or joining a commune, but it’s actually just a nod to a classic social-science experiment . In 1972, the Stanford University social psychologist Walter Mischel undertook a psychology experiment involving preschool kids and a bag of marshmallows. He would sit across the table from each child, take out a marshmallow, and ask, “Do you want it?” Obviously, they did. He told them it was theirs—but there was a catch. He was going to leave the room for 15 minutes. The child could eat the marshmallow while he was gone, if he or she wanted. But when the researcher came back in, if the first marshmallow was still there, the child would get a second one.\\nMischel found that a majority of the kids couldn’t wait, and gobbled up the marshmallow when he left the room. He followed up on the children in the study, and found that those who were able to delay their gratification found greater success as they grew up: They were healthier, happier, and scored higher on their SATs than the kids who had eaten the marshmallow.\\nIn the years that followed, other researchers pointed out that Mischel’s results were about far more than just willpower; they also involved a child’s family background, socioeconomic circumstances, and other factors. But the implication remained: Good things come to those who wait—and work, and sacrifice, and maybe even suffer.\\nRead: Workism is making Americans miserable\\nThe question for today’s graduates is not whether they could have passed Mischel’s marshmallow test; they just passed their own version of it by working and sacrificing to get their diplomas. The question is: What exactly is your marshmallow? Do you know what you sacrificed and suffered for? Do you have a professional calling that is worth having deferred your consumption and gratification all these years?\\nIf you are scratching your head, don’t despair—you don’t have to find an answer immediately. Here, I offer four rules to keep in mind to guide your quest.\\nRule 1. The work has to be the reward.\\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make in their careers is to treat work primarily as a means to an end. Whether that end is money, power, or prestige, this instrumentalization of work leads to unhappiness. The psychologist Elliott Jaques—famous for inventing the term midlife crisis— once quoted a middle-aged patient as saying, “Up till now, life has seemed an endless upward slope, with nothing but the distant horizon in view. Now suddenly I seem to have reached the crest of the hill, and there stretching ahead is the downward slope with the end of the road in sight.” Later, he admitted that he himself was this “patient,” and this was his own lament. He had worked away for years in his career to get some fabulous reward, and then realized that there wasn’t much reward ahead at all, just aging and death.\\nWhen your career is just a means to an end, the payoff, even if you get it, will be unsatisfying. Don’t make that mistake. Your work won’t give you joy and fulfillment every day, of course. Some days it will feel pretty unsatisfying. But with the right goals— earning your success and serving others —you can make the work itself your reward.\\nRule 2. An interesting career is better than a fun career.\\nOver the years, I have endured many graduation ceremonies (although I’m sad that my son’s was canceled), and have observed that there are two basic types of speeches from commencement speakers. The first can be summarized as “Go find your purpose.” The second is “Find work you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.” Which one is better advice? Should graduates seek purpose or fun?\\nRead: You thought you were free, but history found you\\nA group of German and American scholars sought to answer this question in 2017. They created what they called the “Work Passion Pursuit Questionnaire,” comparing the job satisfaction of people whose primary work goal was enjoyment with those whose primary goal was finding meaning in their work. Across 1,357 people in their sample, the researchers found that enjoyment seekers had less passion for their work and changed jobs more frequently than meaning seekers.\\nThis is just an example of the age-old debate over two kinds of happiness that scholars refer to as hedonia and eudaimonia. Hedonia is about feeling good; eudaimonia is about living a purpose-filled life. In truth, we need both. Hedonia without eudaimonia devolves into empty pleasure; eudaimonia without hedonia can become dry. In the quest for the professional marshmallow, I think we should seek work that is a balance of enjoyable and meaningful.\\nAt the nexus of enjoyable and meaningful is interesting. Interest is considered by many neuroscientists to be a positive primary emotion , processed in the limbic system of the brain. Something that truly interests you is intensely pleasurable; it also must have meaning in order to hold your interest. Thus, “Is this work deeply interesting to me?” is a helpful litmus test of whether a job could be or could lead to your marshmallow.\\nRule 3. A career doesn’t have to be a straight line.\\nYoung people today—especially those currently in college and graduate school—have grown up in a culture that worships entrepreneurial success. Vast fortunes have accrued to tech start-up founders in their 20s, and those founders come with a certain mythology. Whether it’s true or not, the entrepreneur is often depicted as having a single abiding passion for which he or she is willing to pay any personal price. Their enormous worldly rewards are portrayed as the ultimate marshmallow.\\nBut this model doesn’t describe how many—perhaps most—happy, fulfilled people have survived and thrived. Scholars at the University of Southern California have studied career patterns and come up with four broad categories. The first are linear careers, which climb steadily upward, with everything building on everything else. The concept of the “corporate ladder” is a very linear one. This is also the model of the billionaire entrepreneur.\\nRead: Kids don't have to stay 'on track' to succeed\\nBut it isn’t the only career model: There are three others. Steady-state careers involve staying at one job and growing in expertise. Transitory careers are ones in which people jump from job to job or even field to field, looking for new challenges. Spiral careers, the last category, are more like a series of mini careers—people spend many years developing in a profession, then shift fields seeking not just for novelty, but for work that builds on the skills of their previous mini careers.\\nSo, which one is best? That depends on you: your tastes, your personality, and your goals. If you crave a super-linear career, that’s okay. Personally, it wasn’t for me. My own career has spiraled more than a pass from Tom Brady. This includes 12 years as a professional classical musician, a decade as a professor, 10 years as president of a Washington, D.C., think tank, and now back to speaking, writing, and teaching. My marshmallow wasn’t any of the specific jobs I’ve held, but rather the professional adventures I have enjoyed, the skills I have gained, and the people who have touched my life.\\nRule 4. Beware of unhealthy passions.\\nPeople often ask why I left the music business.\\nI had been a serious classical musician since the age of nine, and aspired to be the best French horn player in the world. I went pro at 19, played music I loved, and made a living. But something was never right: I wasn’t very happy. I suffered when I was playing, because I felt I was never good enough. I suffered when I wasn’t playing, because I felt guilty about not practicing. I prioritized music over all of my human relationships.\\nIn retrospect, my love for music was obsessive, and that was the problem. In 2003, Canadian researchers studied 900 people engaged in different activities about which they were passionate, including their jobs. Those with what they called “harmonious passion” for their activity experienced positive mood, good concentration, and a “flow state” while doing it. But they also felt fine when they weren’t engaged in the activity. In contrast, “obsessive passion,” while also characterized by intense interest, featured negative mood and poor concentration during the activity, as well as unhappiness when not engaged in the activity.\\nWork is kind of like romantic love in this way. Almost everyone reading these words has had an unhealthy relationship or two. What many unhealthy relationships have in common is obsessive passion: a need to be together, but unhappily so. Obsessive passion brings out the worst in us. In contrast, healthy relationships generate harmonious passion, characterized by happiness and mutual improvement as people.\\nThis rule refines Rule 3. Yes, look for something in which you are intensely interested. But go further and ask, “Is my interest obsessive, or harmonious? Does this job or career bring out the best in me? Does it make me a happier, better person, or, in pursuing it, am I neglecting other important things life has to offer?”\\nIn sum, this is my advice to my son and all his fellow graduates: You’ve passed the first marshmallow test—you worked, sacrificed, and graduated. Congratulations. But there’s another test that awaits, which is to figure out precisely what your marshmallow is. As you search for it, remember that it might not be what you thought at first, nor what the world is telling you.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Over the past year, millions of people flooded city streets, defying China’s government as they demanded that Beijing honor Hong Kong’s civil rights and grant the territory democracy. Those same agitators worked together this winter, at times in opposition to the territory’s leaders, to limit a widespread outbreak of the coronavirus.\\nCertain items linger in the public consciousness as symbols of this period: yellow construction helmets, 3M respirators, open umbrellas that deflected rubber bullets. Long before people feared viral droplets, protesters feared police cameras and so obscured their features with face masks. Yet, perhaps no symbol of defiance has resonated with so many for so long than a four-stanza paean to hope.\\nWithin the first weeks that it was sung in public, “Glory to Hong Kong” became an anthem for residents and Hong Kong’s diaspora , the protest movement’s most potent piece of propaganda. Last year, the song roused people during an uncertain moment in the campaign, as it confronted ever-harsher policing, as well as mulish leaders. By December, with many protesters exhausted after they were routed in a fiery campus siege, the singing sounded like a funeral dirge. Hong Kongers rested during the winter, staying home to ward off COVID-19.\\nRead: Crises are no time for political unity\\nThis month, on Mother’s Day, people met in shopping malls across the city. With spring, the government had eased limits on gatherings, and mall-goers were eager to enjoy their newfound freedoms. The hallways and escalators, however, hummed not with spenders, but with song—specifically, “Glory.” This being Hong Kong, policing tends to leap from absence to 100 m.p.h. in seconds. As the final chords faded, officers in drab olive jumpsuits and riot helmets streamed in and decreed that the crowds had breached disease-control orders. One aimed a rifle at crowd members before firing pepper-spray pellets. By the early hours, police arrested more than 250 people city-wide.\\nFor many here, “Glory” has grown from a mere protest song to one that pledges loyalty—not to a state or an ideology, but to one another. A young demonstrator I spoke with chose in December to mark months of street protests not with barricades and Molotov cocktails as others did, but with song. “To me, this is not just a way to express our identity, but a sort of resistance,” Tsang told me after a rally. (He asked to be identified by only his last name to avoid arrest.) “People can feel the same sort of pain that connects them as Hong Kong people.”\\nIn other words, the bond has nothing to do with China—and that’s a problem for Beijing.\\nChina has long noted that Hong Kong has a patriotism problem. From Beijing’s perspective, the nation rescued the territory from British colonial oppressors; sustained the city in 2003, when another lethal virus struck; and over the years has cemented Hong Kong’s place as a global trade capital. Hong Kong residents were supposed to be grateful.\\nIn 2019, weeks before debate began over a bill to expand the city’s judicial-extradition law, the issue that ignited the current protest movement, Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, ordered the city's legislature to pass a law that required China’s national anthem be solemnly sung, under threat of prison. That demand—love, or be punished—helped broaden the movement beyond demands that China observe Hong Kong’s legal autonomy, to a crusade for liberty and identity. As China’s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress, prepares to meet in Beijing, Chinese officials are pushing Hong Kong’s lawmakers to pass the law and remind Hong Kong residents that this song, and no other, is their national anthem.\\nMost people think of patriotism as an emotional state, a psychological bond with one’s homeland. China, however, considers loyalty to the motherland a component of survival. Supporting the state ensures its sovereignty, the scholars Elaine Chan and Joseph Chan have written. In this view, patriotism is the expression of love for a secure and stable home.\\nYet patriotism differs from national identity, just as there’s a difference between an emotional attachment and a political one, says Ying-yi Hong, a psychologist and marketing professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. While some Hong Kongers respect Chinese culture and traditions, these touchstones provide no attachment for many residents. China, to them, is the Communist state, the antithesis of Hong Kong’s values. In this view, Hong Kongers cherish choice, open elections, individual freedoms, and a legal system that will protect those rights.\\nThe notion of patriotism is particularly complex here. Hong Kong is part of China, and while Hong Kongers carry separate passports and live under a different legal regime, they are by law Chinese citizens. Yet their national allegiances have long been fluid. This is understandable, given the bifurcated history of the city, a place generations of mainland residents and refugees have passed through, en route to a better life somewhere else. During the 1960s, as China frayed amid the Cultural Revolution, Hong Kongers drew confidence from their economy and artistic culture. Residents identified themselves as distinctly different—not British, not Chinese, but Hong Konger. That identity persisted for many citizens, save for the years leading up to 2008, when pride in Beijing as an Olympic host invited an appreciation for China.\\nRead: Is this Taiwan’s moment?\\nWhen the Games concluded, however, researchers noticed that more Hong Kongers expressed ambivalence, even distaste, toward Chinese citizenship. That was initially pinned on economic factors, as many locals blamed mainland arrivals for snatching public housing and school slots. Instead, the researchers H. Christoph Steinhardt and Linda Che-lan Li concluded, after crunching 16 years of polling data, concluded that the choice to identify as Chinese correlated with trust in the central government. Hong Kong residents, they found, didn’t so much become more Hong Kong as less Chinese. People expressed that sentiment by resisting the country’s political and cultural symbols—most pointedly, its national anthem.\\nWhen Britain handed Hong Kong to China, British soldiers marched out after the final notes of “ God Save the Queen .” Their Chinese counterparts goose-stepped in to salute “ March of the Volunteers ” as China’s five-starred flag rose. The bombastic song started out as a film score that gained popularity through mass sing-alongs, similar to how “Glory” was shared in Hong Kong’s acoustically rich shopping malls. Hong Kongers never took to Beijing’s tune, even though it plays nightly on local TV. One big reason is because it is sung in Mandarin, not the Hong Kong language of Cantonese.\\nSince a 2014 campaign failed to achieve democratic elections for the city’s leader, many soccer fans have routinely jeered when the Chinese national anthem is played at local stadiums. In 2018 , Beijing ordered that Hong Kong pass a law requiring the song to be played at all official events, and to be sung with dignity. Before lawmakers could act, however, Lam pushed a bill to allow judicial extraditions to China. Some residents here were already sensitive to Beijing’s encroachments. Media reports of detentions north of the border between Hong Kong and the mainland fanned the anxiety. The prospect of a new law that could allow China to dragoon suspects in mainland prisons amplified fears further.\\nBrian Fong, a government professor at the Education University of Hong Kong, theorizes that Hong Kong is a stateless nation , a community that claims its right to self-governance, a philosophy shared by some Quebecois, Catalans, and Scots. The infrastructure of Hong Kong’s separateness from China is recognized by the international community through the territory’s passports (which offer differing visa requirements from China’s), its currency (which is traded differently from China’s), and its courts, customs, and trade laws. His is a wonkier argument of the political scientist Benedict Anderson’s theory that a nation is an imagined community with a “deep horizontal comradeship,” for which its members have willingly sacrificed themselves. To see the throngs on the streets of Hong Kong over the past year—peaceful marchers clogging streets, backing up frontliners in respirators who withstood rounds of tear gas, and, yes, threw Molotov cocktails, is to see Anderson’s words come to life.\\n“Glory” was unveiled to most of the world on September 8 , during a march filled with fluttering American flags. (Donald Trump would soon sign legislation that punishes Chinese officials who violate Hong Kongers’ civil rights.) As one protester held a megaphone aloft, a respirator on his face, a bandage on his lower right leg where he’d been singed by a tear-gas cylinder, hundreds sang along. The composer who first posted the song’s sheet music on a Reddit-like board still mulls what his two-minute creation started. “If anyone calls it an anthem of this campaign or the unofficial anthem of Hong Kong, it’s the agreement among the public, I will respect it,” Thomas told me. Not that he was advocating the idea, he added. (Thomas refused to divulge his last name, his background, his alma mater, even his age. He worried that the government could accuse someone who posted sheet music of subverting the state, though lawyers have assured him otherwise.)\\nJulia Marcus: Quarantine fatigue is real\\nNow, when residents gather to belt out “Glory,” many seem to be expressing ideas—of independence and revolution—that they long harbored but dared not utter in public.\\nThe song’s pull has surprised even the most hardened residents, including Gordon Mathews, an anthropology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has studied Hong Kongers’ bonds with Britain and China. He concluded long ago that Hong Kongers had an affiliation with an economy, not a state. Hearing residents respond to “Glory” has made him reflect on how the city has changed. “The song is really a sense of a national anthem,” Mathews told me. Hong Kong, he continued, “hasn’t had a sense of country before and now it does. And that’s extraordinary.”\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Find the collection here .\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conflating the results of two different types of coronavirus tests, distorting several important metrics and providing the country with an inaccurate picture of the state of the pandemic. We’ve learned that the CDC is making, at best, a debilitating mistake: combining test results that diagnose current coronavirus infections with test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus. The upshot is that the government’s disease-fighting agency is overstating the country’s ability to test people who are sick with COVID-19. The agency confirmed to The Atlantic on Wednesday that it is mixing the results of viral and antibody tests, even though the two tests reveal different information and are used for different reasons.\\nThis is not merely a technical error. States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.\\nSeveral states—including Pennsylvania, the site of one of the country’s largest outbreaks, as well as Texas, Georgia, and Vermont—are blending the data in the same way. Virginia likewise mixed viral and antibody test results until last week, but it reversed course and the governor apologized for the practice after it was covered by the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Atlantic . Maine similarly separated its data on Wednesday; Vermont authorities claimed they didn’t even know they were doing this. \\xa0\\nThe widespread use of the practice means that it remains difficult to know exactly how much the country’s ability to test people who are actively sick with COVID-19 has improved.\\nRead: There’s one big reason the U.S. economy can’t reopen\\n“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Ashish Jha , the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told us when we described what the CDC was doing. “How could the CDC make that mistake? This is a mess.”\\nViral tests, taken by nose swab or saliva sample, look for direct evidence of a coronavirus infection. They are considered the gold standard for diagnosing someone with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus: State governments consider a positive viral test to be the only way to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antibody tests, by contrast, use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past.\\nA negative test result means something different for each test. If somebody tests negative on a viral test, a doctor can be relatively confident that they are not sick right now; if somebody tests negative on an antibody test, they have probably never been infected with or exposed to the coronavirus. (Or they may have been given a false result—antibody tests are notoriously less accurate on an individual level than viral tests.) The problem is that the CDC is clumping negative results from both tests together in its public reporting.\\nRead: Pools will test the limits of social distancing\\nMixing the two tests makes it much harder to understand the meaning of positive tests, and it clouds important information about the U.S. response to the pandemic, Jha said. “The viral testing is to understand how many people are getting infected, while antibody testing is like looking in the rearview mirror. The two tests are totally different signals,” he told us. By combining the two types of results, the CDC has made them both “uninterpretable,” he said.\\nThe public-radio station WLRN, in Miami, first reported that the CDC was mixing viral and antibody test results. Pennsylvania’s and Maine’s decisions to mix the two tests have not been previously reported.\\nKristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the CDC, told us that the inclusion of antibody data in Florida is one reason the CDC has reported hundreds of thousands more tests in Florida than the state government has. The agency hopes to separate the viral and antibody test results in the next few weeks, she said in an email.\\nBut until the agency does so, its results will be suspect and difficult to interpret, says William Hanage , an epidemiology professor at Harvard. In addition to misleading the public about the state of affairs, the intermingling “makes the lives of actual epidemiologists tremendously more difficult.”\\n“Combining a test that is designed to detect current infection with a test that detects infection at some point in the past is just really confusing and muddies the water,” Hanage told us.\\nRead: Why the coronavirus is so confusing\\nThe CDC stopped publishing anything resembling a complete database of daily test results on February 29. When it resumed publishing test data last week, a page of its website explaining its new COVID Data Tracker said that only viral tests were included in its figures. “These data represent only viral tests. Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data,” the page said as recently as May 18 .\\nYesterday, that language was changed . All reference to disaggregating the two different types of tests disappeared. “These data are compiled from a number of sources,” the new version read. The text strongly implied that both types of tests were included in the count, but did not explicitly say so.\\nThe CDC’s data have also become more favorable over the past several days. On Monday, a page on the agency’s website reported that 10.2 million viral tests had been conducted nationwide since the pandemic began, with 15 percent of them—or about 1.5 million—coming back positive. But yesterday, after the CDC changed its terms, it said on the same page that 10.8 million tests of any type had been conducted nationwide. Yet its positive rate had dropped by a percent. On the same day it expanded its terms, the CDC added 630,205 new tests, but it added only 52,429 positive results.\\nThis is what concerns Jha. Because antibody tests are meant to be used on the general population, not just symptomatic people, they will, in most cases, have a lower percent-positive rate than viral tests. So blending viral and antibody tests “will drive down your positive rate in a very dramatic way,” he said.\\nThe absence of clear national guidelines has led to widespread confusion about how testing data should be reported. Pennsylvania reports negative viral and antibody tests in the same metric, a state spokesperson confirmed to us on Wednesday. The state has one of the country’s worst outbreaks, with more than 67,000 positive cases. But it has also slowly improved its testing performance, testing about 8,000 people in a day. Yet right now it is impossible to know how to interpret any of its accumulated results.\\nRead: Should you get an antibody test?\\nTexas, where the rate of new COVID-19 infections has stubbornly refused to fall, is one of the most worrying states (along with Georgia). The Texas Observer first reported last week that the state was lumping its viral and antibody results together. On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott denied that the state was blending the results, but the Dallas Observer reports that it is still doing so.\\nWhile the number of tests per day has increased in Texas, climbing to more than 20,000, the combined results mean that the testing data are essentially uninterpretable. It is impossible to know the true percentage of positive viral tests in Texas. It is impossible to know how many of the 718,000 negative results were not meant to diagnose a sick person. The state did not return a request for comment, nor has it produced data describing its antibody or viral results separately. (Some states, following guidelines from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, report antibody-test positives as “probable” COVID-19 cases without including them in their confirmed totals.)\\nGeorgia is in a similar situation. It has also seen its COVID-19 infections plateau amid a surge in testing. Like Texas, it reported more than 20,000 new results on Wednesday, the majority of them negative. But because, according to The Macon Telegraph , it is also blending its viral and antibody results together, its true percent-positive rate is impossible to know. (The governor’s office did not return a request for comment.)\\nThese results damage the public’s ability to understand what is happening in any one state. On a national scale, they call the strength of America’s response to the coronavirus into question. The number of tests conducted nationwide each day has more than doubled in the past month, rising from about 147,000 a month ago to more than 413,000 on Wednesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, which compiles data reported by state and territorial governments. In the past week, the daily number of tests has grown by about 90,000.\\nAt the same time, the portion of tests coming back positive has plummeted, from a seven-day average of 10 percent at the month’s start to 6 percent on Wednesday.\\n“The numbers have outstripped what I was expecting,” Jha said. “My sense is people are really surprised that we’ve moved as much as we have in such a short time period. I think we all expected a move and we all expected improvement, but the pace and size of that improvement has been a big surprise.”\\nThe intermingling of viral and antibody tests suggests that some of those gains might be illusory. If even a third of the country’s gain in testing has come by expanding antibody tests, not viral tests, then its ability to detect an outbreak is much smaller than it seems. There is no way to ascertain how much of the recent increase in testing is from antibody tests until the most populous states in the country—among them Texas, Georgia, and Pennsylvania—show their residents everything in the data.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

They can be found buying Tesla cars, watching SpaceX launches, and praising Musk on Twitter. To his fan base, Musk is a visionary, an idol, even a climate superhero. Some of that reputation stems from Musk’s transformation from nerdy internet millionaire to suave manufacturing billionaire. According to Musk mythology, he’s even the inspiration for an actual superhero, Robert Downey Jr.’s portrayal of the charmingly brilliant Tony Stark in the 2008 Iron Man film. In the past 15 years since, Musk’s profile has risen, growing ever Starkian, as if prophesied. Meanwhile, his admirers have become only more notorious .\\nA few months ago, it would have been nearly impossible to imagine Musk’s world-saving sheen wearing off in the eyes of his fans. But that was before the coronavirus pandemic. In the past few months, Musk has downplayed the dangers of the virus, offered unfounded predictions about how many Americans it will infect, and falsely claimed that children are “essentially immune” to COVID-19. He has called, over and over again, for rolling back the widespread measures put in place to slow the spread of the virus, a move that public-health officials believe could be lethal . Musk defied local stay-at-home orders and reopened his Tesla assembly plant in California, bringing thousands of employees into work. “I will be on the line with everyone else,” he tweeted last week, as operations restarted. “If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.” (Tesla and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment.)\\nRead: When Elon Musk switches on ‘insane mode’\\nTwitter is Musk’s main mode of communication with the public, including his fans. During other moments of Muskian controversy—the tweet that led to fraud charges and cost him his Tesla chairmanship, or the time he got sued for calling a rescue diver a “pedo guy”—you could count on finding a chorus of support in the replies to Musk’s tweets, his admirers unwilling to consider any criticism of their hero.\\nBut now, for the first time, Musk appears to have alienated even some of his most devout supporters. Fans are voicing their discomfort, and even dissent, directly to Musk on Twitter, knowing that he might see it. Last month, the top tweet beneath Musk’s demand to “FREE AMERICA NOW” and let workers return to their businesses was a bite-size study in cognitive dissonance: “my first disagreement with my Idol. :/”\\nRead: What you need to know about the coronavirus\\nThe acerbic persona that once made Musk a cool renegade seems to have sharpened into something more alarming in this global crisis. Surviving a pandemic is rocket science only in the figurative sense, and some fans wish that Musk would let the experts handle it. The cracks in the cult of Elon are starting to show.\\nI reached out to some of these fans. They were mostly men, ranging from 20-somethings to 70-somethings. They included those who drive Teslas and those who wish they did, those who describe Musk as their idol and those who just think he makes a great car. They all prefaced their remarks with praise of Musk’s brilliance, vision, and ability to do things that others had sworn were impossible. And besides, they said, nobody’s perfect. But. What the hell is he doing?\\nRead: The mission NASA doesn’t want to postpone\\n“Sometimes it just seems like the smarter people are, the more vulnerable they are to overestimating how much they know about something outside of their specialty,” Ben Hallert, a longtime SpaceX fan and a Tesla stockholder, told me. “If I’m an expert in X, then why wouldn’t I be an expert in Y?”\\nHallert loves talking about rockets. He talked about them all the way from Oregon to Texas last spring, when he took his wife and teenage sons to visit the place where SpaceX is building its biggest rocket yet , just off the Gulf of Mexico. Hallert’s grandparents worked on the Apollo program, and he has his pilot’s license. He can’t wait to see the SpaceX spaceship get off the ground, but he wishes that the man behind it would stop tweeting.\\nRead: The thorniest subject at NASA right now\\nMusk’s early takes on the coronavirus were mild, if ill-advised, fans told me. In early March, for example, Musk declared that “the coronavirus panic is dumb.” Fans believed that Musk was only poking fun at the hoarding of toilet paper and Clorox wipes, not the dangers of a sickness that was cropping up everywhere. But as Musk’s rhetoric escalated, some of his fans tried to reason gently with him that research showed social-distancing measures could slow the spread of the virus. They resurfaced a quote Musk tweeted in 2017, from Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey—“If one day, my words are against science, choose science”—in an apparent attempt to remind him of his better impulses. Such is the understanding nature of Musk fans, who still want to help their hero see the error of his ways.\\nThings escalated from there. About two weeks later, Musk tweeted that, “based on current trends,” the United States would have “probably close to zero” new COVID-19 cases by the end of April. The prediction turned out to be wildly incorrect , but Musk didn’t acknowledge his error. That irked some of his fans, who trusted him to get it right. “If he says, ‘Don't worry, guys. By April we won’t have cases,’ people are going to say, ‘This is Elon Musk. He must know the best doctors. He must know the best people. He must have done the best research before saying that,’” Luis Mireles, a college student in Texas, told me. Mireles has written about Musk and Tesla for school papers, and, like Hallert, has visited the launch facility where SpaceX is working on its Mars rocket.\\nRead: ‘How could the CDC make that mistake?’\\nSeveral fans told me that they’re struggling to reconcile this version of Musk with his pre-pandemic persona. “Calling someone a bad name or insulting someone without evidence is obviously bad, but I think nothing compares to taking human life lightly,” Sun, a scientist in the Bay Area who asked to go by only his surname to protect his privacy, told me. Sun has watched countless Musk interviews over the years in which Musk says egregious but less dangerous things, but the pandemic tweets became so painful to see that Sun eventually unfollowed Musk. “It’s like one of those hero characters in movies where he works on a grand mission and then he loses sight [of it] and thinks that vulnerable people are expendable,” he said.\\nI also heard from many fans that Musk is behaving less like humankind’s savior and more like a ruthless industrialist. This uncomfortable truth seemed to crystallize when Donald Trump tweeted in support of Musk’s desire to restart Tesla operations and Musk thanked him. If Musk is supposed to be a climate hero, he’s suddenly fraternizing with a villain who doesn’t believe in human-caused climate change and has spent his time in office reversing dozens of environmental policies. Only three years ago, Musk removed himself from a presidential advisory council specifically because Trump withdrew the U.S. from international accords meant to address climate change.\\nRead: Of course Twitter loves Elon Musk\\n“I really thought [Musk] could be hero material,” said Lisa Jacobson, an insurance salesperson in Wisconsin. “Let’s face it, we’re ruining this planet and here’s a guy that’s trying to find another place for us to go.” Jacobson misses the benevolent CEO who extended the battery life of Teslas for drivers across Florida—for free—so that they could evacuate during Hurricane Irma in 2017. She expected to see the same Musk swoop in during the pandemic. “Where’s that guy?”\\nThe answer: on Tesla’s factory floor in Fremont, California, as promised. He was there last week as the parking lot filled up with workers commuting for the first time in weeks. No one came to arrest him. Local officials eventually caved , telling Tesla it could stay open as long as the company added some safety measures.\\nRead: No, the internet is not good again\\nPlenty of fans have stood by Musk in this moment. As for others, they are trying to disentangle Musk’s personal philosophy from his contributions to the world, separating the art from the artist—a difficult task when so much of the allure of SpaceX and Tesla is the man himself. Some Musk admirers say they’ve canceled their Tesla orders . One fan in the Seattle area who owns two Teslas—and had a mild case of COVID-19 in March—told me that he believes Musk’s nonstop pronouncements have cheapened the electric-car company’s brand. But Hallert, the rocket lover from Oregon, said Musk’s recent behavior won’t dampen his enthusiasm for SpaceX missions, nor will it stop him from buying one of Tesla’s boxy Cybertrucks someday. (“It’s so ugly, I feel like I have to have it,” he said.)\\nEven though Hallert is still willing to support Musk’s companies, he’s feeling decidedly cooler about the man. “There probably was a time when I would have made any excuse [for Musk] just because my excitement over SpaceX was just that high,” Hallert said. “I’m less likely to make excuses about dumb shit he says to my friends than I was before.”\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

People who love swimming have been writing to Bonnie Tsui, the author of the recent swimming ode Why We Swim , to tell her how much they miss the pool, the beach, or the lake, now that they’re quarantined.\\nFor lots of people, swimming feels like not just a summer pastime, but a ritual that cleanses the body of temporal woes. According to researchers Tsui interviewed, when people rank the enjoyability of different forms of exercise, swimming routinely comes out on top. Water is both comforting and energizing; it clears the mind and buoys the soul. “It’s something that for me is not just the enjoyment; it’s also the tonic of it,” Tsui told me. “It is the medicine that I need to feel like a better person.”\\nRead: The healthiest way to sweat out a pandemic\\nTsui, who lives in Northern California, considers herself fortunate. Though the local community pool where she typically swims four days a week has been closed since March 15 because of the pandemic, she’s still able to swim in the San Francisco Bay. But this summer, millions of American swimmers won’t be so lucky. They’ll be hot, pool-less, and—thankfully, but perhaps not happily—safer from COVID-19 for it. Even in areas where public pools do open this summer, swimmers may have a very different pool experience than they’re used to. For the time being, a pool day might feel less like a mini-vacation and more like a weird exercise class, complete with masks.\\nThe coronavirus can’t remain infectious in pool water, multiple experts assured me, but people who come to pools do not stay in the water the entire time. They get out, sit under the sun, and, if they’re like my neighbors, form a circle and drink a few illicit White Claws . Social-distancing guidelines are quickly forgotten.\\n“If someone is swimming laps, that would be pretty safe as long as they’re not spitting water everywhere,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. “But a Las Vegas–type pool party, that would be less safe, because people are just hanging out and breathing on each other.”\\nRead: Keep the parks open\\nIn areas with few confirmed coronavirus cases, it’s tempting to simply throw open the pool gates and hope for the best. Outdoor areas, like pools or parks, are thought to have a lower risk of coronavirus transmission than indoor spaces. Many Americans have had enough of quarantining , and a few summer pool days may help release our pent-up energy ahead of another potential wave of shutdowns in the fall. For many kids, the pool is summer’s highlight—a natural gathering place and a chance to exercise when it’s too hot to do much of anything else. And indeed, certain pools and water parks in states such as Texas and Georgia have made plans to open this summer, though some will operate at reduced capacity.\\nEarlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered some suggestions for how pools can stay open without turning into viral hot spots. But not only do the guidelines seem far-fetched; if followed, they are likely to make for a somewhat strange pool season. For example, the agency said, pool operators could space lounge chairs six feet apart and disinfect them regularly. They could encourage people to wear masks when they’re outside the water—tan lines be damned. And strangest of all, the CDC recommends somehow keeping people six feet away from one another while they’re in the water.\\nRead: What you need to know about the coronavirus\\nThese are just suggestions; the actual restrictions for swimmers will be up to local public-health authorities and the pool managers themselves. Experts I spoke with offered some more ideas, such as allowing people living at odd- and even-numbered addresses to come to the pool on different days, to facilitate social distancing. Pools could set up a reservation system for lap lanes and keep people from loitering around the pool. Some cities are opening just their largest pools —perhaps because their bigger size would better allow people to spread out.\\nBut these restrictions come with their own drawbacks. People might get frustrated that their designated pool “day” falls on a rainy Sunday rather than a sunny Saturday. And social distancing at pools can be hard to enforce. It’s not really possible to get small kids—some of the most enthusiastic pool-goers—to keep their distance from one another. At the pool, even normal adult behavior tends to devolve into joyous anarchy: If you spot your friend as you’re dipping in and out of lap lanes, are you really going to not stop and say hi? Plus, there’s the fact that lifeguards can’t keep a six-foot distance from someone they’re trying to rescue.\\nRead: Why some people get sicker than others\\nIt’s enough to make some experts think we should just avoid pools entirely this summer. “I don’t know that there’s a safe way for them to reopen, at least not in the way we’ve classically used pools,” says Aubree Gordon, an epidemiology professor at the University of Michigan. “I don’t think it’s a good idea for people to be lounging around outside of pools right now.”\\nShe thinks that this summer we should make the choice to forgo pools—amazing, life-restoring, but, admittedly, not life-or-death pools—to reduce the likelihood of another outbreak. “We may have to keep some things that are nice to have closed or reduced so that we can have the things that are essential open and functioning,” she says.\\nPerhaps realizing these risks, some cities have decided to keep pools closed throughout the summer. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the city’s pools will remain closed all summer, and he’s even warned New Yorkers that he will go a step further and have swimmers plucked out of the water at the city’s beaches. Several other cities, including Roeland Park, Kansas ; Cedar Rapids, Iowa ; Portland, Oregon ; and Evansville, Indiana , have also announced that they will keep their pools closed all summer.\\nRead: America’s patchwork pandemic is fraying even further\\nI thought about all these closures and restrictions as I talked to Tsui. Like her, I love swimming. Though doing laps is great, I like all the other parts about it, too. I get depressed when I think about a summer without reading my book in the sunlight, my legs half-submerged, the pool water slicing through the humidity.

In essence, all of the social aspects of swimming would go away, leaving a tedious husk of exercise and caution.

In the carefully hidden memo, the chief of staff directs the two to secretly and illegally cut off all federal funding to two key swing states, both led by Democratic governors, with the goal of rigging turnout in favor of the president’s party in the 2020 election.\\nNow imagine that the memo leaked to The Wall Street Journal, which splashed the story across its front page. The other major papers would quickly follow. Cable news would cover it wall to wall. There would be congressional investigations.\\nNow imagine that instead of conducting all this skulduggery in private, the president just openly tweeted it out. Actually, you don’t have to imagine it. You can just surf over to Donald Trump’s Twitter feed this morning:\\nBreaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!..\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020\\nState of Nevada “thinks” that they can send out illegal vote by mail ballots, creating a great Voter Fraud scenario for the State and the U.S. They can’t! If they do, “I think” I can hold up funds to the State. Sorry, but you must not cheat in elections. @RussVought45 @USTreasury\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020\\nHere we have two cases of Trump tweeting threats to states that have sought to expand access to voting by mail as a response to the pandemic sweeping the nation, which has already killed nearly 100,000 Americans (you know, the one Trump has repeatedly declared victory over ). And for good measure, he’s tagged Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, OMB Director Russ Vought, and the Treasury Department.\\nThis is one of the many things that makes Trump’s Twitter feed such a bizarre phenomenon. If he did this privately, it would—rightly—be a massive scandal. Yet when he does it as part of a few dozen wildly varied tweets over the course of a morning, it’s written off as just another wacky missive from the wacky president. Becoming numb to Trump’s tweets is easy, as I’ve written of myself , but these show just how dangerous that is.\\nJeffrey Goldberg: Trump’s Mafia mind-set\\nIt’s a crime to try to withhold funds appropriated by Congress in order to interfere with voting. The effort to expand access to mail-in voting is an obviously reasonable response that’s designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 while also allowing the most people to exercise their right to vote. Ideally, this wouldn’t be a partisan matter. Yet Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds from these states because he contends that sending out absentee-ballot applications will benefit Democrats.\\nOne oddity of this tantrum is that there’s no evidence that voting by mail actually helps Democrats , nor is there evidence that it is a major risk for fraud . What Trump is really thinking is hard to know. He has continued to espouse blatantly false claims about voter fraud in 2016, and he may believe them, or perhaps he has simply calculated that higher turnout in 2020 could doom his reelection chances. Trump has left the burden for most of the pandemic response to the states; only when the fallout threatens him politically does he start to throw his weight around. (As Michigan’s secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, noted in reply , Republican officials in several more decidedly red states have taken similar actions, without being threatened.)\\nIn short, Trump is trying to use the force and funds of the federal government to enhance his reelection chances—and if that sounds familiar, it’s because he was impeached in December for doing much the same. In that case, he tried to strong-arm Ukraine behind closed doors to investigate the Biden family; today, it’s just another tossed-off tweet.\\nDavid A. Graham: The stain of impeachment will last forever\\nThese particular messages are part of a new genre Trump seems to be trying out: the tattletale tweet, in which he tags in some other authority and demands that they take action. He recently tagged Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai in complaints about NBC’s Chuck Todd, seeming to call for the FCC to “fire” Todd, a power it does not have. More successfully, he demanded that Senator Lindsey Graham investigate the so-called Obamagate scandal , and while Graham has demurred (so far) on calling Barack Obama to testify, he quickly hopped to and said he would hold hearings, subpoenaing a raft of other officials.\\nThese messages are a little strange on their face, since Trump could easily call Vought or Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and order him to withhold funds to Michigan or Nevada; he could call Pai or Graham privately too. But they would probably tell him that his requests are illegal, and he’d be deprived of a chance to grandstand. Since everyone knows that the president is more interested in performance than execution, and that he often loses interest before following through on things he talks about—remember when he asserted absolute authority over states just a month ago?—he derives some sort of perverse plausible deniability. But dismissing this as another idle Trump threat or musing lets him off too easy and enables his lawlessness.\\nFirst, even if Trump doesn’t follow through on his threats against Michigan and Nevada, he could deter other states from following their lead. Any governor or secretary of state who wants to ensure that voters can get ballots in November will have to weigh whether taking action might imperil federal funding to their state. Sure, any embargo would probably be illegal, but states would have to go to court and might see an interruption of funds at a time when they can least afford it. Even if they don’t, do these officials want to risk the ire of the president and his loyal hordes? Michigan has already canceled a legislative session over violent threats by protesters encouraged by Trump.\\nDavid A. Graham: This is what an unleashed Trump looks like\\nSecond, even if Trump writes off his threats as bluster—he often claims that his gaffes were really “sarcasm” or jokes , most recently and implausibly when he suggested using disinfectants or UV light inside the body to kill the coronavirus—legions of executive-branch employees are ready to interpret his whims and try to act on them. Like an earlier ill-tempered, ginger-haired nepotistic ruler , Trump need only ask offhand for appointees to rid him of a turbulent state .\\nAs my colleague Jeffrey Goldberg has noted, Trump runs the executive branch with a Mafia mentality , and is careful to never be too explicit, even when his intentions are clear. Consider again the impeachment. Ambassador Gordon Sondland clearly understood Trump to demand that Ukraine announce an investigation into the Bidens as part of a quid pro quo, but Trump countered that he never told Sondland it was a “quid pro quo.” Trump’s treatment of officials in the aftermath of his impeachment also demonstrated to appointees that those who follow the law but buck Trump’s whims are vulnerable to public attack and ouster, while those who break the law but indulge the president will be rewarded and protected.\\nThis morning’s tweets are, it is true, just more wild rambling from the president. That doesn’t mean they can’t also be a grave threat to the integrity of the 2020 election.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.\\nDavid A. Graham is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\\nConnect\\n', 'How the Pandemic Will End\\nI spoke with two dozen experts who agreed that in the absence of a vaccine, the patchwork will continue. Cities that thought the worst had passed may be hit anew. States that had lucky escapes may find themselves less lucky. The future is uncertain , but Americans should expect neither a swift return to normalcy nor a unified national experience, with an initial spring wave, a summer lull, and a fall resurgence. “The talk of a second wave as if we’ve exited the first doesn’t capture what’s really happening,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat’s happening is not one crisis, but many interconnected ones. As we shall see, it will be harder to come to terms with such a crisis. It will be harder to bring it to heel. And it will be harder to grapple with the historical legacies that have shaped today’s patchwork.\\nI. The Patchwork Experience\\nA patchwork pandemic is psychologically perilous. The measures that most successfully contain the virus—testing people, tracing any contacts they might have infected, isolating them from others—all depend on “how engaged and invested the population is,” says Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. “If you have all the resources in the world and an antagonistic relationship with the people, you’ll fail.” Testing matters only if people agree to get tested. Tracing succeeds only if people pick up the phone. And if those fail, the measure of last resort—social distancing—works only if people agree to sacrifice some personal freedom for the good of others. Such collective actions are aided by collective experiences. What happens when that experience unravels?\\n“We had a strong sense of shared purpose when everything first hit,” says Danielle Allen, a political scientist at Harvard. But that communal mindset may dissipate as the virus strikes one community and spares another, and as some people hit the beaches while others are stuck at home. Patchworks of risk and response “will make it really hard for the public to get a crisp understanding of what’s happening,” Rivers says.\\nIn one future scenario, the nation splinters. When national news diverges from local reality, “suspicions about whether the epidemic was a hoax will find fertile ground in places with a more ambiguous experience of the disease,” says Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University. Confused people will retreat to the comfort of preexisting ideologies. The White House’s baseless attempts to claim victory will further divide the already fragmented states of America. “In the face of medical uncertainty, people make decisions by returning to their own groups, which are very polarized,” says Elaine Hernandez, a sociologist at Indiana University Bloomington. “They’ll want to avoid being stigmatized, so they’ll follow what people in their networks are doing [even if] they don’t really want to go out.”\\nRead: Why the coronavirus hits kids and adults so differently\\nPrevention is physically rewarding in the long term, but not emotionally rewarding in the short term. People who stay home won’t feel a pleasant dopamine kick from their continued health. Those who flock together will feel hugs and sunshine. The former will be tempted to join the latter. The media could heighten that temptation by offering what Lincoln calls “disparity in spectacle.” Fringe exceptions like anti-lockdown protests and packed restaurants , she says, are more dramatic and telegenic than people responsibly staying at home, and so more likely to be covered. The risk is that rare acts of incaution will seem like normal behavior.\\n“There’s a natural saturation point for images of health systems in crisis,” Lincoln adds, and newly overwhelmed hospitals might be ignored in favor of fresher narratives. The local media are better positioned to pick up the nuances of a patchwork story, but of the counties that had reported cases of COVID-19 by early April, 37 percent had lost their local newspaper in the past 15 years. If the virus does indeed resurge and states need to shut down again, people may not comply, because they’ll be misinformed and distrustful.\\nA second future is also possible. “When this outbreak began in China, everyone said, Thank God it’s not here,” Jha says. “It moved to Western Europe and people said, They have government-run health care; that won’t happen here. Then it hit New York and Seattle, and people said, It’s the coasts. At every moment, it’s more tempting to define the other who is suffering, as opposed to seeing the commonalities we all share.” But as the virus spreads, Americans may run out of others to discriminate against. “Crises are political only until they are personal,” wrote the journalist Elaina Plott, in a piece about a Louisiana woman who convinced her conservative friends to take the coronavirus seriously after her own husband fell sick. Similarly, President Donald Trump’s claims that the virus will go away on its own will ring false to supporters who know someone fighting for breath.\\nThere are signs that this is happening. While Trump’s popularity predictably surged during the crisis, his “rally around the flag” boost was a blip compared with the prolonged peaks of other leaders. Polls have also shown that pandemic partisanship is narrowing, with Democrats and Republicans more united in how seriously they view the threat. Beth Redbird, a sociologist at Northwestern University, has been surveying 200 people a day since mid-March, and “ 70 to 75 percent of people support most social-distancing measures,” she says. “Those are really large numbers in a society where 52 percent is often viewed as huge support. We rarely see that outside of authoritarian polling. Americans are by and large reading information in a very similar way.”\\nEconomic indicators support this view. Even in conservative states, activity plummeted before leaders closed businesses, and hasn’t rebounded since restrictions were lifted. As such, Redbird doesn’t share the widely held fear that Americans have become inured to social distancing and will refuse to suffer through it again. The bigger risk, she says, is that demoralizing bouts of shutdowns and reopenings will nix any prospect of economic recovery. “You only get to say Go out, trust me once,” she says. “They won’t believe you the second time.”\\nBoth possible futures are confounded by three aspects of COVID-19 that make the pandemic hard to grasp, and that are amplified by the patchwork effect. First, the disease progresses slowly. It seems to take an average of four or five days , and a maximum of 14, for an infected person to show symptoms. Those symptoms can take even longer to become severe enough for a hospital stay, and longer still to turn fatal. This means that new infections can take weeks to manifest in regional statistics. May’s declining cases are the result of April’s physical distancing, and the consequences of May’s reopenings won’t be felt until June at the earliest. This long gap between actions and their consequences makes it easy to learn the wrong lessons.\\xa0\\xa0\\nRead: Why some people get sicker than others\\nSecond, the pandemic is shaped by many factors. Social distancing matters, but so do testing capacity, population density, age structure, wealth, societal collectivism, and luck. Many countries that successfully controlled the coronavirus used masks ; New Zealand did not. Many had decisive leaders; Hong Kong did not . It is easy to look at a patchwork and create just-so stories about why one place succumbed while another triumphed. But no single factor can explain differences across nations or regions.\\nThird, the disease spreads unevenly. Some cases infect no one, and others infect many. In Washington State, a choir member infected 51 fellow singers during a few hours of rehearsal. In Ghana, a worker in a fish factory infected 533 colleagues. These “super-spreader events,” which are rare but pivotal, become especially important when cases dip. They mean that an untroubled region may continue that way for some time, but that once cases start growing, they can really grow.\\nIf a state reopens and sees no immediate spike in cases, is that because it was justified, because insufficient time has passed, because other things went right, or because unlucky super-spreader events haven’t yet happened? In a patchwork, these questions will be asked millions of times over, and many answers will be wrong.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is not a hurricane or some other disaster that will come and go, signaling an obvious moment when recovery can begin. It is not like the epidemics of fiction, which get worse until, after some medical breakthrough, they get better. It is messier, patchier, and thus harder to predict, control, or understand. “We’re in that zone that we don’t see movies made about,” says Lindsay Wiley, a professor of public-health law at American University.\\nII. The Patchwork Response\\nA patchwork was inevitable, especially when a pandemic unfolds over a nation as large as the U.S. But the White House has intensified it by devolving responsibility to the states. There is some sense to that. American public health works at a local level, delivered by more than 3,000 departments that serve specific cities, counties, tribes, and states. This decentralized system is a strength: An epidemiologist in rural Minnesota knows the needs and vulnerabilities of her community better than a federal official in Washington, D.C.\\nBut in a pandemic, the actions of 50 uncoordinated states will be less than the sum of their parts. Only the federal government has pockets deep enough to fund the extraordinary public-health effort now needed. Only it can coordinate the production of medical supplies to avoid local supply-chain choke points, and then ensure that said supplies are distributed according to need, rather than influence. Instead, Trump has repeatedly told governors to procure their own tests and medical supplies .\\nRead: Trump i s putting himself at risk for COVID-19\\nMichael Kilkenny of the Cabell-Huntington Health Department, in West Virginia, says his state found itself short on swabs, disinfectant, and protective equipment; unable to compete in the global market; and abandoned by the White House. “It felt terrible,” he says. “We’ve been making homemade masks, or using bleach solutions. We had to fend for ourselves.” While reporting on pandemics in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, I heard health-care workers repeatedly joke that the 15th article of the country’s constitution is “Débrouillez-vous”—French for “Figure it out yourself.” It’s a droll resignation that when resources are scarce, the government won’t fix your problems, and it’s on you to make do. The U.S., a country that’s more than 400 times wealthier, has seemingly adopted “Débrouillez-vous” as national policy.\\nEven health officials in well-off states aren’t comfortable with a situation in which preparedness has more to do with wealth and connections than need. “We have everything we need,” says Angela Dunn, the state epidemiologist for Utah, where Governor Gary Herbert moved quickly to buy and secure tests and supplies. “But we did it in a very capitalistic way, and that’s not the best way to deal with a pandemic.” States have tried to level the playing field on their own. Wyoming ended up with few cases but a glut of testing reagents, which it provided to Colorado and Utah when those states saw spikes, Dunn says. “There’s a small barter system, but it’s not sustainable and it doesn’t work at scale,” she says. “I don’t know if Colorado is lacking supplies. If they have a huge spike, that’ll impact Utah. It’s in our interests to make sure everyone’s protected, and without federal coordination, that’s hard to do.”\\nIn some cases, the federal government has actively undermined the states. Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, tried to buy protective equipment, but was thrice outbid by the federal government; he ended up using the New England Patriots’ jet to fly 1.2 million masks over from China, many of which turned out to be faulty. When Larry Hogan, Maryland’s Republican governor, procured 500,000 tests from South Korea , he kept them guarded in an undisclosed location so they wouldn’t be seized by the feds. This is not federalism working as intended , where different tiers of government work together. Instead of devolving control to the states, the Trump administration has ceded the U.S. to the virus.\\nThe U.S. now heads into summer only slightly more prepared to handle the pandemic that cost it so dearly in the spring. According to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, the U.S. is now testing 366,000 people a day—a record high. But experts estimate that the country needs 500,000 to several million daily tests. Here, too, a patchwork is apparent. An analysis by NPR and Harvard’s Global Health Institute showed that in early May, only nine states were doing sufficient testing, and another 31 weren’t even halfway to their requisite threshold.\\n“I would have hoped for more, considering the cost of that time,” says Natalie Dean, a statistician at the University of Florida. Stay-at-home orders were necessary but ruinous, economically and emotionally. Their purpose was to buy time for the country to catch its breath, steel its hospitals, and roll out a public-health plan capable of quashing the virus. Many such plans exist. Umpteen think tanks and academics have produced their own road maps for dialing society back up. These vary in their details, but are united in at least having some. By contrast, the Trump administration’s guidelines for “ opening up America again ” are so bereft of operational specifics that they’re like a cake recipe that simply reads, “Make cake.”\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prepared a more detailed guide but was blocked from releasing it by the White House, according to an Associated Press report. The guidance it has released seems carefully worded to avoid the term guidelines, as if it’s “trying to fly under the radar,” Wiley says. “The abdication of federal responsibility has left states with little choice but to ease the most disruptive physical-distancing measures without the testing data that would make us more confident that cases won’t rapidly surge.” (The CDC finally and quietly released a slightly abridged version of its fuller report on Tuesday.)\\nRead: There’s one big reason the U.S. economy can’t reopen\\nThe Trump administration “isn’t known for consistency of messaging, so we’ll never put our full faith in that,” says Kilkenny of West Virginia. “We pretty much ran our own state here.” At the time of this writing, only five states and the District of Columbia are still under some form of lockdown. A few, such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Montana, eased restrictions after their caseloads had fallen to low single digits. Idaho is reopening cautiously , despite being one of the less affected states.\\nGeorgia went all in on April 24, reopening gyms, restaurants, theaters, salons, and bowling alleys at a point when it had five of the 10 counties with the highest COVID-19 death rates nationwide, and was testing just a fifth as many people as it needed to. By contrast, Utah revived businesses a week later, when it had more than enough tests for everyone with symptoms, all their contacts, high-risk groups, and even random slices of the populace. Still, Dunn, the state epidemiologist, is nervous. “If we could stick it out for even a couple more months of stricter social distancing, it would do us a world of benefit,” she says. “There are embers everywhere, and they could ignite any moment.” Some states never put their fires out at all: Texas, Alabama, Kansas, Arizona, Mississippi, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and others all reopened while cases were still rising.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It’s inevitable that we’ll see stark increases in infections in the next weeks,” says Oscar Alleyne of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. The experiences of other countries support that view. Success stories like South Korea, China , Singapore , and Lebanon all had to renew or extend social-distancing measures to deal with new bursts of cases. And they had all restrained the virus to a much greater extent than the U.S., which despite having just 4 percent of the world’s population has 31 percent of its confirmed COVID-19 cases (1.5 million) and 28 percent of its confirmed deaths (92,000).\\nIn a connected country, flare-ups that begin in reckless states can easily spread into more cautious ones. Cellphone data, for example, reveal that after Georgia businesses revved back into action, more than 60,000 extra visitors poured in from neighboring states every day. Genetic studies show the risks of such movements. By using patterns of mutations to reconstruct the pandemic’s path, researchers have shown that most of New York’s cases likely stemmed from one introduction from Europe in mid-February. Most of Louisiana’s cases arose from just a couple of introductions from within the U.S. Just a few travelers can spark substantial outbreaks in new places.\\nTo mitigate such risks, about two dozen states have asked out-of-town arrivals to self-quarantine for 14 days. But tighter restrictions would be a logistical and legal nightmare. States can regulate what happens within their borders, but have limited powers to control travel across them. Congress could potentially do so , but it’s unclear if the courts would uphold any restrictions. The right to travel is supported by Supreme Court precedents, but in 1965, the Court ruled that said right “does not mean that areas ravaged by flood, fire or pestilence cannot be quarantined” if unlimited travel would jeopardize the safety of the nation.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnne Applebaum: The rest of the world is laughing at Trump\\nLegality aside, domestic-travel bans are of limited use. Even China’s extraordinary quarantine of Wuhan merely delayed the virus from reaching other parts of the mainland by three to five days . Much like social distancing, such measures only buy time. The better strategy is not to try and prevent the virus from traveling, but to build a public-health system nimble enough to catch it when it arrives. Don’t build one big wall; instead, ready a thousand nets.\\nIn this, the U.S. is also behind. Prevented health threats are less visible than present ones, which means that successful public-health departments tragically make the case for their own diminishment. Since 2008, underfunded local departments have lost more than 50,000 jobs. Even now, Cincinnati’s health department has furloughed 36 percent of its staff . “How can you have a system that’s meant to be at the front line of the defense while it’s losing the staff it needs?” Alleyne asks.\\nSome states are trying to make up for these losses by hiring battalions of contact tracers . These people will call every infected person, talk through their needs, ask for names of anyone they’ve had close or prolonged contact with in the past two days, and call those contacts, too. The process isn’t complicated, but it is laborious. Experts have estimated that the U.S. needs 100,000 to 300,000 contact tracers, and the nation has been slow to recruit them. Selena Simmons-Duffin of NPR reported that only North Dakota had recruited enough as of May 7, although six more states and the District of Columbia were set to.\\nThings are improving, though. When Danielle Allen of Harvard canvassed several mayors in mid-April, they weren’t taking contact tracing seriously. When she spoke with them again in May, “they were on top of it,” she says. “I was blown away by how much changed in three weeks.” New York State alone is planning to hire 6,000 to 17,000 contact tracers, while California is aiming for 20,000. “This really is the best tool we have to manage the pandemic until we have a safe and effective vaccine,” says Crystal Watson at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\\nWill this system, combined with mask wearing and hand-washing, be enough to contain a patchwork pandemic? Complicating matters, people with COVID-19 can spread the coronavirus before showing symptoms. And yet, that hasn’t fazed other countries. South Korea has been rightly praised for its success, and though one nightclub-goer recently sparked a surge of at least 168 cases, the country seems to have contained this new outbreak too . Basic public-health measures have similarly worked in countries as diverse as Iceland, Jordan, Singapore, Germany, and New Zealand. And they have suppressed epidemics of the past, from smallpox in the 19th century to Ebola in 2014. “Some silver bullet isn’t going to save us. We can save ourselves,” says Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at Yale. “We have very old-school tools that beat fucking smallpox .”\\nBut those very old-school tools must also contend with old-school problems, which are difficult to recognize, let alone beat.\\nIII. The Patchwork Legacy\\nThe current patchwork is not random. Nor is it solely the consequence of America’s actions in 2020. It has emerged from a much older, deeper patchwork .\\nU.S. policies that evicted Native Americans from their own lands have long left indigenous peoples with insufficient shelter, water, and resources, making them vulnerable to infectious diseases like smallpox, cholera, malaria, dysentery, and now COVID-19 . Up to 40 percent of the 170,000-person Navajo (Diné) Nation have no running water; they can’t effectively wash their hands. About 30 percent have no power; they burn coal or wood for heat, resulting in irritated lungs that are vulnerable to a respiratory pandemic—a problem exacerbated by uranium mining on their lands. Chronic underfunding has saddled them with crowded living conditions through which the virus easily spreads, dispersed health-care facilities that are low on beds and ventilators , and high rates of chronic conditions that increase the odds of dying from COVID-19. “The lack of basic services on the reservation isn’t due to our choosing to live this way,” wrote Wahleah Johns , a Diné woman, in The New York Times. “It’s because treaties and federal policies dictate how we live.”\\nThanks to traumas that accrued over generations and stressors that accrue over individual lives, the Navajo Nation has more per capita cases of COVID-19 than any U.S. state and nine times as many per capita deaths as neighboring Arizona. While Arizona has loosened its distancing restrictions, the Navajo Nation has been forced to tighten its orders.\\nBlack Americans have fared little better. After the Civil War, white leaders deliberately kept health care away from black communities. For decades, former slave states wielded political influence to exclude black workers from the social safety net, or to ensure that the new wave of southern hospitals would avoid black communities, reject black doctors, and segregate black patients. “Federal health-care policy was designed, both implicitly and explicitly, to exclude black Americans,” wrote the journalist Jeneen Interlandi for The New York Times’ 1619 Project .\\nIbram X. Kendi: Stop blaming black people for dying of the coronavirus\\nThis is one reason why the U.S. still relies on employer-based insurance, which black people have always struggled to access. Such a system “was the only fit for a modernizing society that could not abide black citizens sharing in societal benefits,” wrote my colleague Vann Newkirk II . Over the past century, every move toward universal health care, and thus toward narrower racial inequities, was fiercely opposed. The Affordable Care Act, which almost halved the proportion of uninsured black Americans below the age of 65, was most strongly fought by several states with large proportions of black citizens.\\nLast year, when the Global Health Security Index graded every country on its pandemic preparedness, the United States had the highest overall score, 83.5. But on access to health care specifically, it scored just 25.3. (Out of 195 countries, it tied with The Gambia for 175th place.) That is at least partly the consequence of letting segregationist tenets influence the allocation of health care. “The resulting arrangement all but guarantees an inadequate national response to a national crisis,” wrote Amy Kapczynski and Gregg Gonsalves of Yale .\\nIn almost every state, COVID-19 disproportionately infects and kills people of color —a pattern that Ibram X. Kendi has called “ a racial pandemic within the viral pandemic .” Pundits have been quick to blame poor health or unsafe choices, without considering the roots of either. Racism in policing means that many black people don’t feel safe wearing the masks that would protect their neighbors. Racism in medicine means that black patients receive poorer health-care than white ones. Racism in policy has left black neighborhoods with less healthy food and more pollution, and black bodies with higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, stress, and what the demographer Arline Geronimus calls “ weathering ”—poor health that results from a lifetime of discrimination and disadvantage. “When America catches a cold, black people get the flu,” says Rashawn Ray, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. “In 2020, when America catches COVID-19, black people die .”\\nThese inequities will likely widen. Even before the pandemic, inequalities in poverty and access to health care “were concentrated in southern parts of the country, and in states that are politically red,” says Tiffany Joseph, a sociologist at Northeastern University. Not coincidentally, she says, those same states have tended to take social-distancing measures less seriously and reopen earlier. The price of those decisions will be disproportionately paid by black people.\\nAdam Serwer: The coronavirus was an emergency until Trump found out who was dying\\nVulnerability to COVID-19 isn’t just about frequently discussed biological factors like being old; it’s also about infrequently discussed social ones. If people don’t have health insurance, or can afford to live only in areas with poorly funded hospitals, they cannot fight off the virus as those with more advantages can. If people work in poor-paying jobs that can’t be done remotely, have to commute by public transportation, or live in crowded homes, they cannot protect themselves from infection as those with more privilege can.\\nThese social factors explain why the idea of “cocooning” vulnerable populations while the rest of society proceeds as normal is facile. That cocooning already exists, and it is a bug of the system, not a feature. Entire groups of people have been pushed to the fringes of society and jammed into potential hot zones. Of the 100 largest clusters of COVID-19 in the U.S. , nearly all have occurred in prisons , meatpacking plants , nursing homes , and psychiatric or developmental-care facilities. (The only exceptions are a naval vessel and three power plants; the infamous Grand Princess cruise is only No. 148 on the list.)\\nThese places, along with homeless shelters and immigrant detention centers , are hubs for outbreaks that can easily spread to the surrounding communities. Prisons and nursing homes have staff and visitors who live in nearby towns. Large prisons, in particular, are usually situated in rural areas with small community hospitals that can be easily overrun by an outbreak. And many employees in nursing homes and meatpacking plants are immigrants who care for the nation’s elderly and process its steaks while also being cut off from health care by the Trump administration’s policies . They are both more likely to get sick, and less likely to get better.\\nThis point cannot be overstated: The pandemic patchwork exists because the U.S. is a patchwork to its core. New outbreaks will continue to flare and fester unless the country makes a serious effort to protect its most vulnerable citizens, recognizing that their risk is the result of societal failures, not personal ones. “People say you can’t fix the U.S. health system overnight, but if we’re not fixing these underlying problems, we won’t get out of this,” says Sheila Davis of Partners in Health. “We’ll just keep getting pop-ups.”\\nLeaders can specifically place testing sites in poor, black, and brown communities, rather than the rich, white areas where they tend to be concentrated . New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for example, is turning 24 churches in low-income areas into testing centers, while Maryland Governor Larry Hogan placed a testing facility in the heart of the predominantly black Prince George’s County. Officials can remove people from risky environments: Leann Bertsch, who directs the North Dakota Department of Corrections, has argued that prisoners should be freed if they are over 50, have serious illnesses, or are within two years of parole or release. A bipartisan group of 14 senators has made a similar call for decarceration .\\nPolicies can also support people in protecting themselves. Essential workers earn low hourly wages and cannot afford to miss a shift, even if they have symptoms. “The only way to prevent them from going to work is to give them paid sick leave,” Ray says. The same goes for a minimum living wage, hazard pay, universal health care, stipends for people who are self-isolating, debt moratoriums, rent freezes, food assistance, and services to connect people with existing support .\\nThe pandemic discourse has been dominated by medical countermeasures like antibody tests ( which are currently too unreliable ), drugs ( which are not cure-alls ), and vaccines (which are almost certainly at least a year away ). But social solutions like paid sick leave, which two in three low-wage workers do not have, can be implemented immediately. Imagine if the energy that went into debating the merits of hydroxychloroquine went into ensuring hazard pay, or if the president, instead of wondering out loud if disinfectant could be injected into the body, advocated for health care for all? “We have decades of social-science research that tells us these things work,” says Courtney Boen, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s a question of political will, not scientific discovery.”\\nAnd while a vaccine will protect against only COVID-19 (if people agree to take it at all), social interventions will protect against the countless diseases that may emerge in the future, along with chronic illnesses, maternal mortality, and other causes of poor health. “This pandemic won’t be the last health crisis the U.S. faces,” Boen says. “If we want to be on better footing the next time, we want to reduce the things that put people at risk of being at risk.”\\nOf all the threats we know, the COVID-19 pandemic is most like a very rapid version of climate change—global in its scope, erratic in its unfolding, and unequal in its distribution. And like climate change , there is no easy fix. Our choices are to remake society or let it be remade, to smooth the patchworks old and new or let them fray even further.\\nEd Yong is a staff writer at The Atlantic, where he covers science.\\nConnect\\n', 'Adeshola Makinde\\nLink Copied\\nThis past weekend, the most resonant sound in the world of sports, heard by hundreds of millions of people, was a rattle: the soft, metallic clinking of a soccer ball ricocheting off the back of a goal net at Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, Germany. It was the first live goal the Bundesliga, the highest level of soccer competition in Germany, had seen in more than two months, gently shepherded in by the 19-year-old Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland in a match against FC Schalke 04. The two teams share a deep-seated rivalry dating back nearly a century, and the Bundesliga is renowned for its fan support, with the highest average stadium attendance in the world. What would have once been an inconspicuous sound lost amid a monolithic roar from one of the sport’s great fan bases instantly became a historic artifact of this present moment.\\nGeisterspiele, or “ghost games,” has been the nomenclature adopted to describe the fan-less matches held as the Bundesliga resumed its 2019–20 season, 66 days after it was suspended due to the spread of COVID-19. The name feels apt in more ways than one. Ghost game eerily describes the auditory experience of watching a Bundesliga match now, both at home and at the arena. “There’s no noise,” the Dortmund coach, Lucien Favre, said after the match. “You create a chance, you play a top pass, a goal and … nothing. It’s very, very weird.” Instead, the stadium amplifies only the shouts of the players on the pitch, stretched and homogenized by endless layers of echo. Geisterspiele as a term captures the sense that the communion kindled by live sports in a past life cannot fully exist in this one. Westfalenstadion is built to house 81,365 fervent fans; on Saturday, there were 213 authorized attendees.\\nWhat the Bundesliga match shows is the extent to which sports is a dance of social imagination—with many partners. Michael T. Stuart, a researcher who investigates the philosophy of imagination at the University of Geneva, told me, “Cheering and playing hard are expressions of the same social imagining. Without the cheering, the team lacks evidence that the fans are imagining the same thing they are, and the power of the collective imagining goes down. Without the fans being there to imagine with them, and the other team to imagine the opposite outcome, it’s not a real game.” The power of collective imagining can manifest physically. Professional wrestlers performing during the stay-at-home orders have noted that the hits and bumps they weather over the course of a match sting a bit more without the shot of adrenaline that a huge crowd can create.\\nRead: The mythos of Michael Jordan continues\\nAs elite athletes, whose bodies and minds are steeled by repetition and regimen, return from quarantine to their professional craft, their training will include adapting to a new psychological reality. For those accustomed to playing in packed arenas, the absence of spectators is a big hurdle to overcome. “There’s a reason why people say fans play such an integral role in the process of the game,” Luke Weaver, the Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher, told USA Today . “When you don’t have fans and that atmosphere, it becomes flat. And it becomes a lot of forced energy and a lot of moments you are trying to create instead of [fans] creating it for you.”\\nGetting used to ghost games may be harder for athletes than for their fans. Broadcast media of all kinds have taught listeners and viewers to appreciate the game from afar. But the professional athlete has routines and rituals built around the energizing presence of crowds. Recently restored leagues such as Taiwan’s Chinese Professional Baseball League, the Korea Baseball Organization in South Korea, and the German Bundesliga have offered early glimpses of newfangled coping mechanisms, from “imagination training” for players to cardboard cutouts with the likeness of ticket holders lining the stands. The pandemic is occasioning a reassessment of the fundamental importance of fandom to sports. Live crowds aren’t just a by-product of athletic excellence; they’re also a context that helps to shape it.\\nCutouts of fans, players, coaches, and staff of the Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach at Borussia-Park on April 28, 2020, in Germany\\n“I still think, like, having a game without fans is just—what is the word sport without fan?” LeBron James said in March, before the NBA’s suspended season presaged a national shutdown. “There’s no excitement. There’s no crying. There’s no joy. There’s no back-and-forth … I just don’t know how we can imagine a sporting event without fans. It’s just, it’s a weird dynamic.”\\nJames’s sentiment gets to the heart of sports, which (even when played individually, like tennis or competitive swimming) is psychologically collaborative. Sports offer guidelines that allow humans to explore our physical potential, but the guidelines themselves do not mean anything. Meaning is generated in the space between the athlete and the spectator; meaning comes from the narratives that are born of witnessing the body do extraordinary things and having those actions validated and celebrated by others. The highest-caliber athletes might be self-motivated , but their drive is always in conversation with the expectations of those who watch them perform.\\nRead: The end of the NBA’s G.O.A.T. era?\\nUproarious fans in a stadium create a pressurized atmosphere designed to test the mettle and anxieties of an athlete. The most effective distractions assault the senses; arguably the biggest star of the 2010 FIFA World Cup was the vuvuzela, the South African horn that, in the hands of thousands of spectators, created an inescapable (and occasionally debilitating ) wall of sound. But with enough preparation, that tension becomes just another fixture of the game environment, an expectation programmed into the unconscious mind. “It’s actually quite distracting to have that quiet an environment that doesn’t force you to focus,” Angus Mugford, the vice president of high performance for the Toronto Blue Jays, told me.\\nEmpty seats at the Borussia-Park football stadium in Mönchengladbach, Germany, on April 16, 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic\\nOf course, there is a very familiar scenario in which athletes perform without the benefit—or hindrance—of crowd noise: practice. Given that practice is inherently a simulation of potential in-game situations, it should provide a strong frame of reference for how to approach ghost games. But transposing one context to another won’t provide a perfect match, as early reactions are already showing. Players, fans, and team personnel who have described the ghost games as “weird” or “surreal” are reacting to that sense of incongruity, and to the uncanny valley that has formed in that in-between context.\\nRead: Baseball’s strange and poignant return to TV\\nAs training facilities across North America begin opening their doors, athletes will have to build the emotional stakes of the game within those hollow practice environs, using their imagination to fill in the blanks. “I’ve actually been at practice where they pipe in noise to prepare for loud stadiums,” Taryn Morgan, the director of athletic and personal development at the IMG Academy, an elite prep school that also offers physical and mental training to college, professional, and Olympic athletes, told me. “So if I’m a team and I’m practicing, I would make sure it’s completely silent now.”\\xa0 \\xa0\\nMorgan continued: “It’s going to be about who’s going to adapt the best. We always say: You want to have been there, done that, so many times before you ever are in the situation. So that you have thrown that winning touchdown in the Super Bowl thousands of times in your life before you ever try to do it. This is another opportunity to prepare [in that way] … Then when they get to the moment when they actually have to perform, it’s going to give them a much better shot to perform successfully. That would be a really weird thing, to walk into [a ghost game] with no preparation. I mean, I can’t imagine how empty it might feel.”\\nSports leagues making plans to return are using the Bundesliga, the Korea Baseball Organization, and the Chinese Professional Baseball League as models for best practices. Mugford told me he’s been in contact with the KBO and other leagues to get a sense of how the logistics of hygiene and safety have been accounted for. “Not very sexy stuff at all,” he admitted. But the research helps to prepare the Blue Jays to act in accordance with the protocols that would allow games to resume, as outlined by the MLB—which have reportedly been documented in a detailed, 67-page (and counting) proposal. However, as the granular provisions and safeguards are hammered out to bring the games back, the reality of ghost games on the other side of that bureaucracy persists. In that relative silence—the game performed without in-person spectators—lies sports’ existential reckoning, and perhaps an answer to LeBron’s question. Can sports ever feel the way it used to without live crowds? Can athletes actually bring a stadium to life with their imagination?\\n“In theory, yes,” Michael Stuart said. While the sensory input from an empty gym will never reflect that of a raucous arena, a vivid, hyper-phantastic imagination can conjure fans and project a comforting image of support with at least some of the emotional resonance of the real thing. “There is a very well-known connection between imagination and emotion,” Stuart said. “And emotions are one of, if not the most important, motivator in the human psyche.” On Saturday, after their victory against Schalke, Dortmund players assembled in a row, staring at Westfalenstadion’s vacant south terrace—which, in another time, would have housed 25,000 screaming supporters—and, as they’ve always done, they applauded the efforts of what the soccer world has dubbed the Yellow Wall . It was a show of acknowledgment and appreciation for some of the biggest fans in sports, a ritual upheld even in a time of uncertainty. It was imagination at work. \\xa0\\nThat connection between imagination and emotion is a muscle that fans build their entire lives. And it reveals itself in different ways: as petty as engaging in greatest-of-all-time debates on Twitter, as sentimental as passing sports allegiances down to a loved one. Fandom is a sense of community held together by the power of collective imagination—the feeling of belonging to a greater whole, even if the individuals have no physical or spatial relation. Now, as ghost games temporarily unravel the live stakes of athletic performance, athletes will have to develop that muscle themselves, to bring sports back to the shared, ruminative landscape it has always been.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

And some day, we must all rush back to one another and rebuild our communities.\\nMay 20, 2020\\nThomas Dworzak / Magnum\\nLink Copied\\nSarah Davis survived the Holocaust. Decades later, when she was 95, she succumbed to COVID-19. Six of us stood around her grave at measured distances from one another; her children and grandson spoke of her life. In the far distance, four mortuary employees waited for the service to conclude so they could fill in the gravesite. All of us wore masks.\\nLater that same day, a woman whose father had died called to ask about sitting shiva, the week of mourning in the Jewish tradition, in this time of pandemic. “The first requirement is staying home, correct?” “Yes,” I replied. “Everyone is doing that anyway,” she said. “I suppose,” I told her, “the whole world is sitting shiva.” She said she found it strangely comforting.\\nJudaism is a tradition built on community. Religion, said the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, is what a man does with his solitude. Not in Judaism. Some important prayers, including the kaddish for the dead, are to be recited only when at least 10 people are present. In Hebrew, a synagogue is called not a “house of worship,” but a “house of gathering.”\\nRight now religious leaders of all faiths are asking themselves: Will community ever come back as it once was? This question has been asked before. At Sinai Temple, the Los Angeles synagogue where I am the senior rabbi, the community went through a similar experience during the 1918 flu. Our centennial history book, published in 2007, tells of the arrival of a new cantor on the heels of that calamity:\\nHis arrival truly was cause for celebration. It marked the end of a compulsory 2-month ban on all public gatherings—including religious worship—to help prevent further spread of a deadly and raging influenza pandemic. Known as “Spanish Flu” or La Grippe, the influenza of 1918–1919 was a global disaster. Families feared death not only from war, but from disease, as well. And with good reason: more people died of influenza in that single year than in four years of the Black Death during the Middle Ages. Nearly half of the American soldiers who died, died not of war injuries but of the flu.\\nThe ability to congregate once again in public, plus the beauty of Cantor Silverman’s voice, brought increasing numbers of worshippers to Friday night services (which were better attended than the Shabbat morning service), and it became apparent that increased seating capacity would soon be needed. Thus began the campaign to create a “Greater Sinai.”\\nThat was before all the technological advances that have brought services, classes, and discussions online. Now when all the dinners and tributes and graduations are canceled, we mark them on Zoom—a frozen dinner in place of a feast. Rabbis around the world with whom I have spoken question the durability of ancient practices. How deep will congregants’ commitment to their synagogues be after months of this? I recall an observation that one of the most significant aspects of the 1969 moon landing was that, for the first time in history, when people wished to see the moon, instead of walking outside, they sat in their living rooms and watched it on TV. Each morning, we watch services on a screen instead of gathering in the synagogue. When the pandemic wanes, will we trade our sweatpants for suits and join together again? In a society where commitment to institutions is waning and “joining” is no longer the social norm, synagogue attendance was already on the decline. Will this pandemic accelerate the trend or (hope against hope) revive the need to gather in prayer and celebration?\\nMy inclination is to believe that human nature is immutable, that when we take off our masks, we will rush, smiling, back into one another’s arms as people did a century ago. I want to believe that community is a deep existential need and nothing fundamental will change. I know that I can’t wait to see people gathered again at services, at weddings, even at funerals. But for all the certain proclamations about what the world will be like, we are none of us prophets, and so we wait to see whether the human hunger for community will override the lingering fear of illness and the frictionlessness of watching from a distance.

The New York Post and The New York Times , which rarely agree about anything, seem united in the message that New York is in deep trouble—because the people who fled the coronavirus will decide never to return and the businesses that are letting their employees work remotely will never go back to the old ways. So much for our tax base, so much for our city, the story goes.\\nIt’s an old story, though—much older than the pandemic. “The obituary of New York City has been written more than once and it’s always been proven incorrect ,” the head of the Real Estate Board of New York, James Whelan, told the Times in April. Whelan has a horse in this race. Namely, New York City’s most expensive asset: its land. Still, predicting the end of New York is so common, it’s practically a literary genre (one that never seems to have the ring of truth).\\nAfter 9/11, we were told that fear of terrorism would kill New York; during the Great Recession, rumor had it that New York would go the way of Lehman Brothers; after Hurricane Sandy, we heard that New York would soon be underwater. Lately we’ve been made to understand that affluence is destroying the character of the city . Now the cause of death is the pandemic, which will make cities in general, and New York in particular, deeply undesirable. The Times claims that pandemics “ are anti-urban ”; Foreign Policy warns that “if fear of disease becomes the new normal, cities could be in for a bland and antiseptic future, perhaps even a dystopian one .”\\nEldalieee\\nWhat’s true is that a lot of wealthy people in particular have left the city—something we know from cellphone tracking and mail forwarding . What we don’t know is for how long. Another old story is that the people who leave New York come back. Joan Didion wrote the classic essay on getting out of Dodge, “Goodbye to All That,” and guess what? She lives here now. Meghan Daum wrote about leaving New York in 1999 and she lives here now too. Well, not now now. Recently she fled to Virginia to quarantine . But she assured me via email that she wouldn’t stay away forever.\\nWhat’s also almost certainly true is that the city will be poorer when this is over. As anyone who listens to Governor Andrew Cuomo’s daily updates knows, the state’s finances are in bad shape, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seems disinclined to help. It’s possible that the deadbeat federal government will not support the Wuhan of America and that New York will have to endure rounds and rounds of devastating budget cuts, of the kind we haven’t seen in decades.\\nBut even if the rich abandon us, and even if the people who were eventually going to move to the suburbs choose that life a little sooner, and even if the treasury runs empty, that doesn’t mean New York will die. At worst, it means that the New York of the present will die. And the New York of the present is always dying.\\nEldalieee\\nThe city has survived many different versions of itself. My kids have grown up in the shadow of Gossip Girl. New York, to them, is a city full of ditzy wealthy people. I grew up in the graffiti-decorated, crime-filled New York of the ’80s. My parents grew up in the bohemian New York of the ’60s. New York can adapt. New York does adapt. Sometimes the city’s full of garbage, sometimes limos and super-tall skyscrapers, and once upon a time horse-drawn carriages and fur merchants. If the coronavirus brings back some of the grit we’ve lost, I won’t mind. I’m sure I’m not the only New Yorker who thinks it’s about time for a reset anyway.\\nBefore we turn to the future, though, we need to mourn our dead—something those prediction pieces tend to just skip over. Whether or not New York is dying, its people are. We’ve lost some 20,000 souls in the city, and we’re still losing about 100 more every day. We have to wrap our minds around the sheer magnitude of our collective loss: the dead grandfathers and grandmothers, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, friends and neighbors. The first thing we have to do when the pandemic ends is hold long-postponed memorial services and honor the first responders, the hospital support staff, the nurses, the transit workers.\\nThen we can go about proving the haters wrong, again.

The article lingered over discussions within Democratic policy circles about a universal basic income, a federal jobs guarantee, a revised tax code, and an effort to rebuild America’s manufacturing base.\\nYet, in more than 2,000 words, it offered no details about foreign policy at all. Similarly, Gabriel Debenedetti of New York magazine recently described Biden’s plans for a presidency “more ambitious than FDR’s,” but largely avoided international affairs.\\nThese omissions are telling. While the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to win over Bernie Sanders voters have pushed the Biden campaign to embrace a more ambitious domestic agenda, little evidence indicates that the presumptive Democratic nominee is doing anything comparable on international affairs. That’s a pity, because America’s relationship with the world needs dramatic rethinking too.\\nLast week, the Biden and Sanders campaigns unveiled six “ unity task forces ” to rally Democrats around an agenda that merges Biden’s incrementalist instincts with Sanders’s more transformative ones. The task forces—which include big names like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, John Kerry, and former Attorney General Eric Holder—cover climate change, criminal-justice reform, the economy, education, health care, and immigration. Foreign policy isn’t on the list.\\nThe Biden campaign does have foreign-policy working groups, lots of them. They’re broken down into subcategories: defense, intelligence, the Middle East, and so forth. Democratic-foreign-policy insiders told me that these panels include hundreds of wonks, who produce reams of documents, which are sent to top Biden advisers like Antony Blinken, Julianne Smith, and Tom Donilon. But the working groups don’t wield much power; one former Obama-administration official characterized them to me as “window dressing.” And because the identities of the people chairing them are secret, they are harder to influence than the unity task forces established on domestic policy. “The fact that they don’t have a public foreign-policy working group means advocates are jumping through hoops to figure out who to talk to,” one progressive foreign-policy activist told me. “It makes it harder and more challenging to communicate with the campaign.” (This activist and the former Obama-administration official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.)\\nThis comparative secrecy might be less of a concern had Biden laid out a more specific foreign-policy agenda. But compared with his major primary rivals, he’s been vague. Take the defense budget. During the primary, Elizabeth Warren proposed cutting military spending by $800 billion over 10 years. Sanders suggested cutting it by $1.2 trillion over 12 years. Biden’s plans are more opaque. A February 2019 Politico survey identified him as one of the candidates who wanted to “boost the defense budget.” In November, by contrast, he told Military Times, “We can maintain a strong defense and protect our safety and security for less.” Reading the entrails, the Brookings Institution’s Thomas Wright suggested in The Atlantic in March that while “defense-budget cuts are possible” in a Biden administration, “top priorities are reforming and modernizing the military to reflect new technologies and repairing civil-military relations.”\\nIn other words, Biden isn’t planning to expend much political capital to shrink the Pentagon. Stephen Miles, the executive director of the progressive advocacy group Win Without War, told me he worries that a Biden administration may embrace the principle of “parity,” in which—to gain Republican support in Congress—“domestic investments like health care, education, and infrastructure must be matched dollar for dollar with more money for the Pentagon’s bloated budget.” Laicie Heeley, a former analyst with the Budgeting for Foreign Affairs and Defense program at the Stimson Center, predicted to me, “When it comes to defense, a Biden presidency is likely to look very much like an Obama presidency, and that’s going to look not so different from a Trump presidency when you really look at the numbers.”\\nThe pandemic—which has already killed roughly 30 times as many Americans as 9/11—offers Biden the chance to break out of the parameters established by his predecessors. As the national-security analysts Joseph Cirincione and William Hartung recently noted in The National Interest, the U.S. spends $740 billion a year on the military and $11 billion on global public health. Hospitals teeter on the edge of bankruptcy while the Pentagon spends about $500 million a year on marching bands.\\nBiden could use these ghastly discrepancies to challenge the view that military spending can only be trimmed at the edges. One way to do that is by demanding that the Pentagon pass an audit, something—as Fareed Zakaria recently pointed out —it has never done. Another is to aggressively challenge the Trump administration’s plans for massive increases in spending on nuclear weapons. A third is to call for the repeal of the 2001 and 2002 congressional resolutions that have given three presidents the power to wage war for nearly two decades. On his website, Biden says he’ll “ end forever wars .” But unless he ends the legal basis upon which those forever wars rest, the U.S. is likely to continue dispatching Special Forces and launching drone strikes with minimal congressional oversight.\\nInstead of challenging the Pentagon’s sky-high budget, Biden’s highest-profile foreign-policy foray since clinching the Democratic nomination has been to try to out-hawk Donald Trump on China. In April, the Biden campaign ran an ad, filled with menacing images of Chinese troops, that accused Trump of having “ r olled over for the Chinese .” A pro-Biden super PAC accused the president of “outright acquiescence to China.” Getting to Trump’s right on China may strike Biden’s advisers as a shrewd way to neutralize the GOP’s line of attack. But it perpetuates the Cold War narrative that hawks are already using to sustain massive defense spending.\\nThe impetus to out-hawk Trump also makes it harder for Biden to expand America’s commitment to the World Health Organization, which the president and his allies have derided as a tool of Beijing. On his website, Biden proposes greater international cooperation against COVID-19. His campaign, however, has spent far more energy bashing China than defending the WHO—thus helping to create a political climate that makes such cooperation harder. It’s another example of Biden’s refusal to do in foreign policy what he appears ready to do in domestic policy: Use the pandemic to fundamentally reshape the American political debate.\\nJust because Biden isn’t laying out a transformative foreign-policy vision doesn’t mean he wouldn’t be a significant improvement over Donald Trump. Blinken, Jake Sullivan, and Colin Kahl, who served as Biden’s national-security advisers while he was vice president and remain influential now, are widely regarded as thoughtful, capable, and decent.\\nThe problem is that Biden’s political team appears convinced that, while campaigning on an ambitious progressive domestic agenda would boost his election prospects, campaigning on an ambitious progressive international agenda could leave him vulnerable to Trump’s jingoistic attacks. As a result, Biden is failing to use the pandemic to win a mandate for a radically different foreign policy. Given what Democrats should have learned in recent months—about the desperate need to free up money to fight off a near-depression, and the desperate need to improve international cooperation before the next pandemic hits—it’s a failure that may haunt them for a long time to come.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

In The Devil’s Dictionary, the journalist Ambrose Bierce defined the O-word as “the party that prevents the government from running amuck by hamstringing it.” The Pulitzer-winning historian Richard Hofstadter argued that “modern democracy was created by the competition between political parties and is unthinkable without them.”\\nYet a crisis always prompts suggestions that opposition is either nitpicking, destabilizing, or outright traitorous. In early April, nearly two-thirds of Britons said they would support a government of national unity to tackle the coronavirus. The implication was that taking party politics out of the equation would improve the country’s response. History is often conscripted into this pro-unity argument. The former Conservative Party treasurer Michael Ashcroft this month satirically claimed that if the Second World War happened today, common questions would include “Does the siren apply to everyone?” “Why can’t I have almond milk on my ration card?” and “Why didn’t we have stockpiles of Spitfires [fighter planes] at the start of this conflict?”\\nHowever, he was invoking an aspect of the past that didn’t exist. The government of the time did face questions about the clarity of its messages, vegetarians were entitled to special ration books , and equipment shortages were a subject of parliamentary debate . Eight months into the war, Neville Chamberlain—the architect of the appeasement policy toward Hitler—was forced to resign as prime minister. Later, even though Britain had a wartime “national government,” there was still an unofficial leader of the opposition. The importance of scrutiny in a democratic country, even one at war, was understood.\\nRead: The pandemic’s geopolitical aftershocks are coming\\nIn the face of an immediate threat to the nation, “there’s a legitimate desire to pull together,” Robert Saunders, an expert in British history at Queen Mary University of London, told me. “But when has this produced good decision making?” He pointed to the example of the First World War’s early days, when the press consistently raised questions over artillery-shell shortages. By contrast, in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, the Labour government in London had a large parliamentary majority, meaning it could ignore protests that its actions were rushed or ill-considered. For an opposition to exist is not enough; it also needs to be heard.\\nDuring the coronavirus crisis, the British government has dismissed criticism as opportunistic, and better saved for a future (and as yet theoretical) public inquiry. Ministers have been quick to seize upon the idea that the media, in particular, have gone too far. “Frankly, the way questions are being asked by journalists irritates a lot of the public at the moment,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the broadcaster ITV last month.\\nWhy are those in charge throwing their weight around like this? Because they can. A government has the power to offer bailouts, to throw lifelines to threatened industries, to tell citizens where they can go and what they can do. Many incumbents around the world have benefited from a coronavirus poll bounce , a phenomenon that political scientists call the “rally-around-the-flag effect.” The pandemic has also pushed leaders forward. Donald Trump regularly preens about the ratings success of his press conferences; here in Britain, daily briefings by the prime minister or his chosen lieutenants lead the news coverage overnight and into the next day. In France, Emmanuel Macron’s prime-time broadcast on April 13 was watched by an estimated 86 percent of the country. The unshowy Angela Merkel had high ratings for a similar address , telling Germans that “since World War II, there has been no greater challenge to our country that depends so much on us acting together in solidarity.”\\nThese leaders can make full use of their bully pulpit, but their opponents struggle to be heard at all. “Where is Joe Biden?” asked a BuzzFeed article at the start of April. “Online, being drowned out by the coronavirus and Trump.” In Britain, the new leader of the opposition, Labour’s Keir Starmer, is trying to break through. His positive approval ratings suggest that he is having some success.\\nStarmer has one advantage that many other opposition leaders around the world do not: The British parliamentary system was designed with adversarialism in mind, right down to its architecture. Politicians sit on two sets of benches facing each other in the House of Commons, and every Wednesday, the leader of the opposition gets to ask the prime minister six questions, live and face-to-face.\\nRead: Britain just got pulled back from the edge\\nAs a former lawyer, Starmer has used these sessions to prosecute a sharply defined case against the government. The first time he faced Boris Johnson, his initial question was open-ended and unanswerable. The prime minister had hailed the “apparent success” of the government’s approach, even as Britain recorded the highest death toll in Europe, Starmer said. “That is not success, or apparent success, so can the Prime Minister tell us: How on earth did it come to this?” The next week, Starmer flustered Johnson again with a question about elderly care, leading to a beautifully childish rebuttal from an unnamed Downing Street source, quoted in the Financial Times: “Keir Starmer is the one who was rattled.” The FT also reported that the prime minister’s team wanted an end to social distancing in the Commons sessions in order to get more cheering supporters behind him during such encounters.\\nStarmer is an interesting test case for how to oppose during a crisis, because he became the Labour leader in early April, after Britain was already under lockdown. He has only been a crisis leader. He entered the job carrying little political baggage; commentators have found identifying his precise political beliefs difficult. In his very first speech, accepting the leadership, Starmer promised to “engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake.” His precise jabs at Prime Minister’s Questions allow him to maintain that line. He also secured a prime-time slot on the BBC to respond to Johnson’s plan to ease the lockdown, during which he voiced statesmanlike praise of key workers, rather than overtly partisan attacks on the prime minister.\\nHis approach has been calibrated to deal with the government’s current popularity—while betting that it will not last. “There isn’t a mood for slashing political attacks,” Saunders said. “There is a mood for careful questions on [personal protective equipment] not being delivered.” Starmer’s bet is that social distancing, and the economic disruption it brings, will last for many months, and that the government’s poll lead will start to wither. At that point, he will have a track record of established criticisms to point to, rather than seeming opportunistic.\\nThe judgment call for any opposition leader during a national crisis is how to move between acknowledging the size of the government’s task, contributing to a sense of solidarity, and criticizing specific policy failings. Michael Howard, who was the Conservative leader when terrorists killed 52 people in London in July 2005, told me that it was important for an opposition not to undermine “a sense of national cohesion.” In the first Prime Minister’s Questions after those bombings, he did not go on the attack, but instead offered sympathy to the families of those killed, and made a nonpartisan point about the importance of not blaming British Muslims for Islamist terror. “Where you pitch the balance will vary from crisis to crisis,” he said. “I think [Starmer] probably just kept inside the line—just—of not overstepping the mark.”\\nHoward pointed out another pressure that opposition leaders face—from lawmakers within their own party, who might relish tough talk. Starmer beat the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s preferred candidate to the party leadership, and some of his colleagues , as well as left-wing activists , would like to see him challenge the government more strongly.\\nBritish voters should be glad that Starmer is providing effective opposition—whether they support his party or not. As my colleague Anne Applebaum has pointed out , the pandemic has given leaders in countries such as Israel and Hungary an excuse to award themselves greater powers, many with broad popular support. Even the most liberal and rule-abiding politician feels the pull of “running amuck,” as Bierce put it, by preventing the opposition from “hamstringing” their decisions.\\nAnne Applebaum: The people in charge see an opportunity\\nExpect calls for unity to increase if and when the national mood shifts and support for the government dwindles. Emerging from lockdown presents a new and difficult challenge for the Conservatives, the traditional party of the wealthy: As knowledge workers can stay at home while the lower-paid return, and as unions question whether the government is endangering lives to allow businesses to reopen, this is a perilous time for the government. Although everyone has had their life disrupted by the coronavirus, the pain is not being felt equally. That leaves huge scope for unhappiness and resentment.\\nSaunders predicts a period of bitter political polarization ahead. “It’s in the nature of a crisis like this,” he said. “You get an economy of sacrifice, in which people weigh their own sacrifice against others’. People who’ve been working through this, they feel very jealous of people who have been furloughed and have got time on their hands. People who have lost jobs will feel that others got their salaries paid all the way through.”\\nVoters currently say they want unity from their politicians, but voters are fickle. Keir Starmer has shown one successful way to oppose a government during a crisis. Might he need a completely different approach to oppose a government in the aftermath of one?\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Mostly this is because One America News seems to agree with Trump about everything, in the same way a dog agrees to chase its own tail. Every day, Trump does something that catches OAN’s attention, and it’s off to the races. He’s part ringleader, part muse. If you’re wondering just how deep the fealty goes, consider this actual headline that ran on oann.com at the end of March, when Trump was still in his denial phase about the coronavirus: “President Handling Emergency Well in First Term.” So well, in fact, we should just give him that second term right now, wouldn’t you say? Every so often, Trump and Fox News have a lover’s spat, and this is when he really turns on the charm toward OAN—retweeting its praise of him, calling on its correspondents at press briefings two days in a row. Or, to put the relationship in tabloid terms familiar to Trump: He treats OAN like his sidepiece, and Fox News like a future ex-wife.\\nOne America News predates the Trump presidency—it launched in 2013—so its rise is less a response to Trumpism than an extension of the besieged, paranoid worldview that got him elected in the first place. In 2018, well after the debunking of Pizzagate—the allegation that Hillary Clinton and a secret cabal were running a pedophile ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant—the network hired one of Pizzagate’s chief boosters, Jack Posobiec, as an on-air correspondent. (Posobiec has backed down from the Pizzagate theory, telling The Washington Post in 2016 that he thought his live-streamed look into the pizzeria “could just show it was a regular pizza place.”) OAN covered the so-called migrant caravan—a slow-moving wave of migrants that began rolling north from Central America in 2018—as if it were a Category 5 hurricane. OAN has referred to the 2016 murder of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee employee, as if it might have been a political assassination; tin-foil-hat corners of the internet have connected it to the leaking of DNC emails. Recently, OAN has been advancing the theory, without any evidence to support it, that the coronavirus was developed in a Chinese bioweapons lab, and spread from there. Soon enough, The New York Times reported that administration officials were pushing the intelligence services to investigate, even as the theory was debunked on the front page.\\n“Our big secret and a key differentiator of OAN from other cable news networks is that the star of OAN’s news lineup is the news, not the talent,” Charles Herring, the network’s president, told me by email recently. Now on the one hand, ouch—on-air talent likes nothing more than hearing their boss say they weren’t chosen for their talent. On the other hand, he’s right: At OAN, what comes out of their mouths is far more important than how well they say it. To watch OAN is to experience the Trump presidency the way Trump himself would cover it, if he built a network from the ground up and then, as he did with his administration, hired amateurs to run it. I spent hours watching OAN, and the whole time I found myself yearning for the skill and professionalism of Fox News. In the age of alternative facts, though, a news network doesn’t need polish to be dangerous. All the talent needs to do is look into the camera and read off the teleprompter.\\nTrump’s frequent shout-outs have turned OAN into a minor media sensation, and its coverage has been described as “fast paced,” which is only true if you’re comparing it with the burning-Yule-log channel. As I watched One America, it gradually dawned on me that I was watching Anchorman. Everything was so earnest and slapdash, and so transparently inane. In both appearance and metabolism, OAN is a nostalgia machine—familiar, reassuring, the Turner Classic Movies of cable-news networks. It’s built for the members of an aging #MAGA army who want to be comforted by news the way they remember it. The same good news, the same bad news. The same invisible enemies too, so that even the nightmares come wrapped in a warm blanket. Gang violence at the top of the hour, baby pandas at the bottom. OAN is post-parody: It’s the straight truth for Trump fans, and completely surreal for everyone else.\\nRead: The pro-Trump conspiracy theory that’s becoming a new religion\\nOAN was born on the Fourth of July seven years ago, when Trump was already deep into his birtherism phase. The network is headquartered in an office-park cul-de-sac in San Diego, a city that, in addition to being the setting for Anchorman, is the longtime corporate base of One America’s founder, the microchip multimillionaire and aging paterfamilias Robert Herring, Charles’s father. Robert built his fortune as a manufacturer of circuit boards, cashing out of two companies in 2000 with $122 million. He and Charles broke into television in 2004 with WealthTV, now known as AWE (A Wealth of Entertainment), a cable channel that would feature shows such as Cheese Chasers and Dream Cruises. Robert also started giving money to conservative causes. In 2005, he made news when he offered $1 million to the husband of Terri Schiavo—a young woman who spent years in a vegetative state as her husband and parents fought in court over whether to end her life—if he agreed to keep her on life support. (He declined the offer.) When Robert and his son decided that Fox News had gotten too soft, too centrist, they launched One America to compete with it.\\nRobert Herring does not poke his head out much, granting only the occasional brief interview to his local San Diego Union-Tribune. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, though, he has been tweeting about it regularly. On April 20, he posted about hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug that Trump has touted as a cure for COVID-19—and now claims to have taken himself—despite the lack of evidence that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for the coronavirus and the emerging evidence that it may cause harm:\\nPresident Trump was the first to tell us about hydroxychloroquine. Now there are MANY reports of people taking it and being 100% cured. So what happened to the trials in New York? Where are the results? Why aren't more doctors pushing it and why aren't people allowed to use it?\\n— Robert Herring (@RobHerring) April 20, 2020\\nNot a word of this tweet is accurate, not even the part about Trump being the first to tell us about the drug. Robert just lobbed it out there, and then vanished behind his Twitter account. Like its founder, One America does not reveal much about itself. A two-page media kit on the network website carries this boast about One America: “Fast becoming the 4th rated national cable news channel!” But I couldn’t find a single press contact. The anchors seem to have written their own bios, possibly copied from their Tinder profiles. Emily Finn, who is 23, according to anchorswiki.com, is described as someone who loves traveling (“especially to Dublin, Ireland … her most favorite place in the whole world”) as well as “jamming to some classic rock music, or soaking up the sun at the beach.” I scoured the site, clicking on every tab, until I happened to click on a page called “Affiliate Relations,” and there it was, kindly supplied for OAN viewers: Charles Herring’s direct email address. So I emailed him. He emailed right back.\\nConor Friedersdorf: Maybe Trump isn’t lying\\n“One America News Network is a small family business,” Charles wrote when I told him I’d been surprised to find his personal contact information right there on the OAN site. “Our staff does the best job they can do with the resources we have. Many of our staff members play numerous roles, including me.” In another email, Charles wrote: “Glad that you have taken the time to watch on Roku (and thank you for the $4.99 per month!\\n) You’ll get a good sense of the channel by watching, rather than reading opinions from advocacy ‘journalists’ [who] admit they have never watched the channel. Let me know how I can be helpful.”\\nAnyone with a mobile device can watch One America in chunks on YouTube, or through the network’s app, or on the streaming service Roku, but the majority of One America’s viewers are, like Trump, TV watchers. In order to watch it on TV, you have to live in the right place, because only a smattering of U.S. cable operators carry OAN, representing a potential pool of about 35 million households, or less than a third of the total U.S. television audience. The network’s precise viewership remains a mystery. The Herrings don’t participate in Nielsen surveys and have declined to share subscriber data. But according to the scant available data from Comscore and conversations with industry analysts, at least 34.5 million of those households are not watching OAN.\\nThe more you search for evidence of OAN viewers, in fact, the less they seem to exist. “If you look at the constellation of sources around the 2020 election, OAN registers but it doesn’t make the top thousand,” says Ethan Zuckerman, a Web 2.0 pioneer and media and public-policy professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. “That surprised me … but it seems like they’re really focused on being a TV network rather than a multimedia platform.” Indeed, most of the segments on OAN’s YouTube page have just a few thousand views. OAN often gets compared to Breitbart News, but it exemplifies a reversal of Brietbart’s strategy under Steve Bannon, which sought to leverage social media aggressively. One America may be relatively new, but it seems almost pre-web.\\n“Breitbart really embraced this idea that it wanted to be shareable in all these sorts of formats—they wanted to show up in video, they wanted to go viral,” Zuckerman told me. “I don’t think that’s the game OAN is playing.”\\nCharles Herring was right: In order to understand OAN, you have to take in every second of airtime, from the Wikimedia stock footage of pills on a factory belt to the advertisements for military-grade tactical sunglasses. And then you have to think about what the hell happened in the world to produce such a sealed-off vision of modern life—half-comforting, half-paranoid, like a Truman Show for angry retirees. Every so often, you feel an invisible hand at work. On April 17, shortly after Trump picked a fight with the protective-mask manufacturer 3M , One America aired a segment about a San Antonio–area nurse who’d made a medical-grade face mask that, according to the OAN anchor’s opening line, “works even better than 3M’s N95 mask.” The nurse boasted about her mask’s 99.5 percent filtration rate (which, if true, would be better than 3M’s) and the fact that so far she’d made 600 of them. The premise of this segment seemed to be: Eat it, 3M! Just a few commercial breaks later, an advertisement urged viewers who’d suffered hearing damage from faulty earplugs to join a class-action lawsuit against … 3M. Coincidence? Maybe. In One America’s America, though, there are no coincidences. Everything is a conspiracy.\\nAll of One America’s anchors bear an uncanny resemblance to more famous anchors on other networks. The bespectacled, babyish-faced Alex Salvi hosts a prime-time show called After Hours that airs at 10 p.m., but before you get any naughty ideas, it’s more like watching a high-school production of All In With Chris Hayes. Then there’s Graham Ledger, who spent nearly 15 years anchoring San Diego’s KFMB-TV local news, which means that, yes, prior to joining WealthTV and One America, he was Anchorman’s Ron Burgundy. You could spend all day fuming about border security and still fall asleep face-first into a bowl of Ledger’s word soup. One of the soft bigotries of right-leaning opinion journalism is that brunettes don’t get to be righteously indignant—this is a job for spitfire blondes. Liz Wheeler, the host of 9 p.m.’s Tipping Point, is a slightly desiccated Megyn Kelly whose hobbies include emasculating the libs. If Ledger is OAN’s bid to take back the Anchorman archetype, Wheeler is a conservative fantasy of Ron Burgundy’s love interest and rival co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone.\\nDoppelgängers abound. Patrick Hussion, who hosts OAN nightly news at 5 p.m., which is technically the late afternoon, looks haunted, like a half-in-the-bag David Muir. John Hines, who interviews many of OAN’s big gets—regulars include Representative Devin Nunes of California and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar—has mastered Chris Wallace’s very sober manner, right down to the very sober head tilt. Wallace, though, is a born inquisitor. Hines is trained to heel. One afternoon, I watched him hold an expression of squinty encouragement for nearly five unbroken minutes as Nunes went on about a “highly suspicious” weapons lab in Wuhan and about the World Health Organization’s alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.\\nIf you’ve encountered OAN out in the world, though, it’s probably not because of Ledger or Hines or Hussion. One America gets talked about for one overriding reason: Trump keeps calling on its correspondents during press conferences. By now, a pattern has emerged. He calls on an OAN correspondent; the correspondent asks a bewildering question; everyone in the briefing room turns around to see who the hell just asked the bewildering question; then Trump thanks the correspondent for serving up such an incisive meatball. For weeks, Trump labored to shift blame for the pandemic onto China by referring to the coronavirus as the “China virus” or “Wuhan virus,” provoking charges of thinly veiled racism. He received a helpful boost from OAN’s chief White House correspondent, Chanel Rion, whose name is pronounced Sha-nell Ree-ohn. (Rion is Korean American; her father’s surname is Ryan.) Her question on the matter was more akin to a preemptive defense with a question mark stuck on the end: “Mr. President, do you consider the term Chinese food to be racist because it is food that originated from China?”\\nRion does seem to have a knack for head-scratching behavior. According to a Daily Mail investigation, she changed her surname from Dayn-Ryan to Rion shortly before applying for a White House security clearance (which is a peculiar moment to change your name). The newspaper reported that Rion’s father, Dann Ryan, has gone by the names Christopher Preboth, Dan Ryan, Danford Nmi Dayn-Ryan, Michael David Ryan, and David Michael Ryan. One reason he may have changed his name so many times is because, according to the Daily Mail account, he kept getting accused of defrauding people in real-estate scams.\\nEllen Cushing: I was a teenage conspiracist\\nBreaking news is very expensive and, for the Herrings and One America, very overrated. Charles Herring has said that his family pumps tens of millions of dollars into One America, but for a national TV-news operation, that’s pennies in a bottomless well. In all the hours I spent watching One America during the pandemic, I never saw evidence of a second camera in the studio. I never saw a field correspondent deliver a report from anywhere other than the White House. Some of the male anchors should not be dressing themselves.\\nIn any case, why break news when you can just repeat the already broken stuff? When I emailed Charles about what he considers the high points of OAN’s history as a news network—an incisive meatball of my own—he didn’t seize the open invitation to boast. “The high points,” he replied, “are simply executing on our mission, namely providing credible national and international news. Having staff break important news stories is always a high point for any news organization.” It sure is. But he didn’t name any of those stories.\\nI thought Charles might tout the network’s hard-hitting coverage of the 2020 presidential election, in particular its coverage of Joe Biden. A vague theme emerged from the many segments I watched—see if you can spot it: “Joe Biden stumbled through another interview today …” “Concerns about his cognitive decline are reportedly on the rise …” “Joe Biden’s gaffes continue—that’s according to his harshest critics.” (Yes, even Biden’s harshest critics were willing to speak out.) The anchors hit their prescribed marks with a mixture of amusement and pity. They could barely contain themselves at a clip of Biden referring to the coronavirus as “the Luhan virus.”\\nIn my email exchange with Charles, I tried to nail down a few more answers. Given the tenor of One America’s pandemic coverage, I asked him if he personally knew anyone who had become ill with COVID-19. For some reason, he didn’t want to reply on the record. I also asked him for examples of times OAN has had to correct its work, because I couldn’t find very many myself. “Unfortunately, we make errors on a frequent basis,” he replied. “Most are very minor and simply corrected. At times, we’ve made on air corrections.” One correction I did find was a “report removal” tweet walking back an infidelity accusation; the tweet repeated the original accusation and stated that the item was removed “pending additional sourcing.” Charles is right about how often One America gets things wrong, but wrong about how often One America sets them right.\\nDespite its tiny audience, One America can still be a useful vector for propagandists, both foreign and domestic, even unwittingly. A conspiracy theory that pops up only in, say, a Russian propaganda organ, or in the mouth of a spiral-eyed congressman, can’t travel as widely as one that receives some sort of American media imprimatur, however shabby.\\nThis requires a bit of a dance to work. For instance, a guest can speculate ominously about Chinese plots, but the interviewer has to sit there, thunderstruck by the logic of it all, and not ask even the most basic of questions. Okay, walk me through this: Scientists in a Chinese bioweapons lab developed the coronavirus and then ... what? Turned it loose on their own people? Or did it get out by accident—a monkey escaped, a test tube spilled, that sort of thing? Liberated from critical probing, innuendo does its work.\\nFor years, coastal elites roared with laughter at Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert as they dressed up as newsmen and turned a familiar ritual of American life into a nightly punch line. Throughout the Obama presidency, liberals comforted themselves with the idea that they’d mocked a certain kind of news program out of existence, and that sanity had triumphed. But during Barack Obama’s second term, the post-truth pendulum swung back hard, from left to far right, from parody to propaganda, from Obama doctrine to Trumpism.\\nOne America may be Donald Trump’s favorite news network, but that doesn’t mean he stays up all night watching it. If there’s one thing we can all agree that Trump really does know something about, it’s good (“good”) television, and I just can’t picture him having any patience for One America’s production values. “The key to success in this space is that you actually have to look enough like a news network to have some influence … and that’s what Breitbart did incredibly well,” Zuckerman, the media analyst, said. “It really has to have luster and gloss to it. And then when it’s simultaneously disturbing, that’s when it has power.” OAN, though, skipped the luster-and-gloss part. Zuckerman went on, “If you don’t have it—even if the product is really provocative—it’s going to fail.”\\nSo many times while watching One America, I went back and forth about how “dangerous” it is, how alarmed we should be, what threat level it represents. One America’s sponsorship roster remains on the skimpy side—appliance insurance, class-action suits against Trump foes, a selection from the William Shatner oeuvre. The network has survived this long only because of the oxygen hose that Trump provides. And when he’s gone? One America isn’t Fox News. The Herrings aren’t the Murdochs. Someone else will replace them. It might be someone with much better news chops. It might be someone more insidiously adept at using the cover of journalism to erode trust in journalism. It might even be people with ties to Trump. According to news reports , the investment firm owned by the family of the Republican National Committee co-chair and Texas investor Tommy Hicks Jr., a friend of Donald Trump Jr., has been exploring possible options.\\nCharles Herring demurred when I asked him about the rumors. “We didn’t build OAN to sell it and we are excited about the future,” he wrote. “We’ll look at any growth opportunities, yet we are not looking to sell our business.” In that case, for the time being, let’s savor a virtue of the network that just about everyone can acknowledge: It’s unwatchable.\\nDevin Gordon is a writer based in New York City.\\nAbout\\n\", 'Or is the world just depressing?\\nMay 19, 2020\\nLink Copied\\nMany of our isolated lives fit the normal criteria for depression, but of course these aren’t normal times. So when the world is this depressing, how do you tell when you’re actually depressed?\\nOn this episode of Social Distance, the clinical psychologist Jennifer Rapke joins James Hamblin and Katherine Wells to explain how to think through mental-health questions in the time of COVID-19.\\nListen to the episode here:\\nSubscribe to Social Distance on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or another podcast platform to receive new episodes as soon as they’re published.\\nWhat follows is an edited and condensed transcript of their conversation.\\nKatherine Wells: Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?\\nJennifer Rapke: Sure. This is Dr. Jennifer Rapke. I’m a clinical psychologist and I am currently the chief of child-psychiatry consultation services at Upstate Golisano Hospital in Syracuse, New York.\\nWells: So what do your days consist of right now?\\nRapke: Right now, we’re still trying as a hospital to keep as few bodies on site as possible. So my days are sometimes at home doing virtual work and sometimes on site. But our role in the hospital is to work with any kids under the age of 18 that are coming in with a mental-health chief complaint. So they’re here for depression, anxiety, suicide, all kinds of things.\\nWells: And is your work essentially the same as it was in pre-corona world? Or are you kind of doing or experiencing something different now?\\nRapke: That’s a hard question. My answer is always: It depends, as a psychologist. The content is technically the same, our role in the hospital is still the same, but our method of doing that is very different right now. Normally, I’m physically in the hospital five days a week, so virtual is all new for us. And we’re also really only seeing people when they absolutely have to be here, so the cases we’re seeing are a little bit more severe.\\nJames Hamblin: When we talk about depression, often the medical system has the job of distinguishing: Is this a context-dependent situation where it’s going to go away? And at what point it becomes a pathology.\\nI understand it is a spectrum, but you as a clinician, you have to decide whether or not someone gets that diagnosis in their chart or doesn’t. There’s kind of a black line that has to be drawn because of the way the system is arranged, at least. And I’m wondering if that line has changed for you at all in the current situation.\\nRapke: I see it on a continuum. All of us have varying levels of depression at different points in our life. All of us have varying levels of mood swings at points in our lives. When does it get to the point where, as a profession, we draw this line? The DSM is the main way we do that, where you have to meet certain numbers of criteria, but I never want a family to feel like that discounts their experience. So I don’t in any way want people to misunderstand that just because we don’t say that it gets this code doesn’t mean that that discounts their experience.\\nJust to go back, it has changed a little bit. At what point would we just talk to a friend? It’s very similar to medical triage, but it’s sort of developing what those levels are. Can I call a friend and feel better, and that sort of changes things? Or have I called all the friends, baked all the cookies, and I still can’t seem to get out of this funk? That’s sort of the first level. If getting up and going for a walk, doing things that would normally help me feel better, talking to somebody that always helps me—if that doesn’t do anything, now we’re to the next point of: How long have I been feeling this way? Has it been just today? Or has it been lasting several days, where I really can’t seem to get myself out of this state?\\nAt that point, you really need to reach out to somebody, whether you have a pastor or a good friend that has a little bit of experience or knowledge. It’s at that point that maybe you need to reach out and do a little bit of screening, maybe even go online to some of the screeners online, some of the reliable ones through your local hospital.\\nAnd then I think at that point, if that screener comes up, if your friend who normally can snap you out of it thinks this is more than your normal funk, then it’s time. You definitely have to reach out to somebody, whether it’s a hotline, your pediatrician, a counselor you’ve talked to in the past.\\nWells: Those three levels you were describing for kind of self-assessment of how severe things are—do those change, given the fact that so many people are going through traumatic experiences right now, like job loss and death in the family up to housing and food insecurity? Like, does it change how you think about those levels or—\\nRapke: I think those levels maybe are the same all the time. I think the pace of those levels probably changes right now. Because normally you can leave the house, you can go somewhere, you can do fun things. And if you can’t do that right now, that probably speeds up the timeline a little bit because the resources that you would have to try to snap yourself out of it are more limited.\\nWells: Something Jim and I have been talking about a lot, and I’ve been joking about it, is, like, we’re all so depressed. It’s a depressing time. Everything’s horrible. Of course we’re depressed. But I feel like this is a good reminder that of course this is a depressing and sad situation and there’s so many things happening that are worthy of mourning, but clinical depression is not necessarily feeling sad because something bad has happened. It sounds like you diagnose less on the initial feeling and more on the ability to cope with the feeling?\\nRapke: There are specific content criteria for depression or anxiety. But the big thing that really distinguishes that continuum where we all have some level of sadness and depression is: Is it impairing our functioning? Are we able to still take care of our children, to take care of our pets, to do whatever job or tasks we’re needing to do?\\nMaslow’s hierarchy of needs is a thing I go back to all the time. One of the weekends that I worked on the crisis line, I spoke to this woman who is in a lot of distress and I said: “You are trying to care for all of these people around you and do all of these really concerned things, but you’re also concerned that you guys don’t have enough food and that you guys don’t have clothes or diapers for the baby or formula.”\\nLet’s take care of these things first, because in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the base of the pyramid—and you can’t function without a good base—is food, water, shelter. So if I can’t feed myself, if I can’t feed my family, if I can’t have a roof over my head, if I can’t have basic clothing to keep myself warm and survive, I can’t do other things.\\nSo anytime I have someone that’s in crisis, that’s how I organize their concerns: Let’s focus on the basic, core things and make sure that you feel secure in that. And then maybe you’ll feel more capable of doing these other things.\\nSo the takeaways are functioning, distress, and then: Am I about where everybody else is? I think that’s where the COVID question comes in. Are we all clinically depressed, or are we all just adjusting to a really stressful situation?\\nHamblin: It sounds similar to how an internal-medicine doctor doesn’t want to see someone coming into the hospital already in multi-organ failure and delirious. It would have been much easier to know that person at their baseline and see them a bit earlier. And in psychiatry it’s never ideal to hear from someone for the first time when they can’t go to the food pantry or can’t get off their couch and can’t do the things they know they normally would be able to just because they’re in the depths of depression.\\nAt the same time, we have a lot of people feeling these symptoms, and it sounds like if we put the entire burden on the mental-health system and had everyone who was in the early stages of these symptoms reach out, there would be an overwhelming wave. And so things like food and housing insecurity—these things that might be at the root of some of the hopelessness and despair people are feeling—are systemic issues that we can’t put all on mental-health care later, because people can’t deal with these circumstances. It’s the circumstances that we can fix. Otherwise, we’ll just see this flood as it builds up in people who meet these criteria, but we could have prevented it.\\nRapke: Yeah, ideally we would be doing more primary prevention. The ratio would be more about doing the food and shelter and water and housing first, and then that would trickle down to other stuff. Secondary prevention is sort of a targeting of risk populations. And then tertiary prevention is you’re just trying to not make it worse. Unfortunately, most of the time we’re doing tertiary. I would love to see, as a society, as a community, more primary efforts. But that’s really complex, especially right now when resources are super tapped.\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

/ Brian Smialowski / Getty / The Atlantic\\\\nLink Copied\\\\nAround the corner from Dublin’s historic St. Stephen’s Green lie Ireland’s Government Buildings.\", 'Here sit the offices of the Irish prime minister—or Taoiseach.', 'Since February, political ownership of this most prized piece of real estate has been up for grabs, following a general-election result that left no party with a clear claim to power.', 'Then the pandemic struck.\\\\nIreland looked up from its own troubles to see the coronavirus outbreak hurtling toward its shores.', 'It had a diminished leader, a political crisis, and a health system that had for decades been a source of domestic controversy, dispute, and angst.', 'Yet, three months on, the incumbent, Leo Varadkar, remains in situ, and most pundits now expect him to stay in office as part of a power-sharing arrangement.', 'And while Ireland’s response to the pandemic has been far from perfect, particularly in relation to retirement homes and testing, its overall performance appears to have held up in comparison to many other European nations.', 'In fact, Ireland today finds itself watching the two countries it knows best—Britain and the United States—with a partially justified (though rarely acknowledged) sense of schadenfreude.\\\\nIreland’s experience, however, illustrates only part of the pandemic’s counterintuitive leadership story, in which political strength appears to offer no obvious guide to national performance.', 'The other part is the emergence of largely anonymous public-health experts as overnight celebrities, trusted authorities, and, to varying degrees, surrogate leaders.', 'In war, it is generals who vie with prime ministers and presidents for power and affection; today it is chief medical officers.\\\\nIreland, along with the U.K. and the U.S., is a prime example of this trend.', 'Ten minutes’ walk from the prime minister’s office, a mural has gone up on the boarded-up window of a pub, paying tribute to the country’s leadership through the pandemic.', 'It depicts a balding, middle-aged man in a suit, opening his shirt to reveal a Superman-style top with the letters TH emblazoned across his chest.', 'This is Tony Holohan, a physician and Ireland’s chief medical officer—the man whose advice is at least partly responsible for shutting the pub in the first place.\\\\nHolohan and his counterparts Anthony Fauci in the U.S. and Chris Whitty in Britain have been thrust into positions of authority, power, and influence at a time when worried populations are looking for guidance.', 'Their sudden prominence reveals as much about the political culture in which they operate as it does about the advice they have given.', 'Yet it also raises questions about the nature of leadership in modern crises—and the temptation among today’s leaders to avoid taking responsibility for the controversial decisions required to manage them.\\\\nRead: America is thirsty for Anthony Fauci\\\\nIn the U.S., Fauci, the plainspoken avatar of the White House’s coronavirus task force, has given credibility to a president whom most Americans don’t trust to tell the truth.', 'Yet Donald Trump never likes to be upstaged, and he’s begun to publicly clash with Fauci over the timetable for rebooting the economy.', 'Fauci has called for a cautious approach, predicting that states could see a spike in infections and endure needless “suffering and death” should they reopen prematurely.\\\\nAfter Fauci delivered his warning at a Senate hearing last week, Trump rebuked him, renewing speculation about whether the president was preparing to part ways with the respected infectious-disease expert who has advised the past six administrations.', '“He wants to play all sides of the equation,” Trump told reporters last week.', 'Fauci, 79, is the rare senior government official who’s unafraid to tell the president uncomfortable truths, and has shown no sign that he’s inclined to back down or trim his advice to fit Trump’s political imperatives.\\\\nAsked in a recent interview with The Atlantic about how he’s evolved into a pop-culture icon—his face is imprinted on bobblehead dolls—Fauci said simply: “This country is looking for truth and honesty, and looking for someone who tells it like it is.” He continued, “I happen to be the right person at the right time.', 'But I really don’t take that personally and say, It’s about me and I’m such a great thing.', 'It’s what the country needs.', 'I happen to be the figure that’s there, and that they’re latching on to.”\\\\nThe obvious difficulty for Fauci in particular, but also for Holohan and Whitty, is that sometimes political leaders do not like to hear how it is.', 'Still, leaders must consider more than one truth when weighing how to act, and cannot just leave it to their generals to make decisions for them.', 'If there is a trade-off between epidemiological and economic considerations, this is an inherently political problem, not a medical one.\\\\nRead: Anthony Fauci, lightning rod\\\\nIn the U.S., there now appears to be a willingness to prioritize economic concerns over medical advice ahead of November’s general election.', 'By contrast, in the U.K. and Ireland, politicians remain much more closely aligned with their advisers, insisting that they are being “led by the science” and will not do anything that contradicts medical expertise.', 'Such proximity, however, is a double-edged sword, and not only for the public in each country, but the advisers themselves.', 'The danger for Holohan and Whitty is that while their immediate job prospects might look far more secure than Fauci’s, the continued political deference to their expertise potentially leaves them more exposed to scapegoating, as well as unfair pressure that they are somehow responsible for balancing considerations that rightly belong to elected politicians.\\\\nUnlike in Britain and the U.S., where daily coronavirus updates are led by politicians, in Ireland the press conference is chaired by Holohan himself.', 'With the country shut down, Holohan is the man with the information and the authority to whom the public has been asked to turn.', 'In Fauci’s words, he is the man telling it like it is, and the reviews have been positive.\\\\nThough it remains early in terms of Ireland’s overall response, and the cause of the country’s success is still up for debate, most of the people that I spoke with in Dublin—including a senior member of the government, a former senior official, and political journalists—agreed that the emergence of “Dr.', 'T” had been an essential part of the Irish story so far, helping to foster a sense of social unity that was not as clearly on display in the U.S. and Britain, where politicians had been more obviously front and center each day.\\\\nHolohan’s prominence and the lack of a permanent new government, however, is beginning to be noticed, those I spoke with said.', 'While Holohan has thus far been accepted as a leading voice in the crisis, he cannot be expected to be responsible for the kind of trade-offs that will be necessary as Ireland tries to emerge from the lockdown.', '“There’s a sense, now, that the absence of a government is becoming an issue,” the former official, who is still in touch with senior government figures and privy to internal discussions, told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\\\\nIndeed, Holohan is beginning to face questions about the problems in Ireland’s retirement-home sector.', 'Given his central importance and public position, he is in the firing line as much as his political masters.', 'The potential criticism raises questions about how government advisers can be held to account when they are not elected—and, equally, how they can be protected from being scapegoated by politicians whose job it is to make the decisions.\\\\nRead: America’s patchwork pandemic is fraying even further\\\\nSimilar questions are now being asked in Britain, where, contrary to the public perception, Boris Johnson is much closer in behavior and outlook to Varadkar and other European leaders than he is to Trump.', 'Like those other leaders, Johnson has been at pains to insist throughout that he has followed the science and to ensure there is little difference in messaging between himself and his expert advisers.', 'As in Ireland, this has led to increased support for Johnson—but also widespread trust and support for Whitty.', 'And just like in Ireland, Whitty has also found himself depicted in public art .', '(In contrast to Holohan, however, he has not appeared in public every day, and when he does, he typically stands alongside the prime minister and a second adviser.)', 'As in Ireland, attention is beginning to turn to what went wrong and the toxic question of who is to blame.\\\\nWhether in Dublin, London, or Washington, we are looking to our modern-day generals for leadership, truth, expertise, and clarity.', 'But for their sake as much as ours, we should not forget who is in charge.', 'The buck doesn’t stop with Holohan, Whitty, or Fauci—but with Varadkar, Johnson, and Trump.\\\\nPeter Nicholas contributed reporting.\\\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.', \"Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.\\\\nTom McTague is a

do you go from this tiny prototype in eight people where they didn’t seem to be harmed, to a billion people with a needle in their arm?', 'It is a technical process that could go a few different ways, depending on our capacity or willingness to incur risk.', 'We can play it really safe and do it really slow, but lots of people are dying every day of this disease.', 'There are incentives right now to take risks that usually vaccine-development people wouldn’t take.\\\\nAn idea that is being discussed in vaccine circles is “human challenge trials,” which we’ve done for some other viruses, but they are not being done right now for this coronavirus.', 'They involve giving people one of these test vaccines and then purposefully exposing them, in a standardized way, to the virus.', 'When you have a disease like this, you have to get a huge number of people with the test vaccine and then see what percentage gets sick and what percentage doesn’t.', 'But [with a regular trial] you don’t really know who is actually exposed [to the virus].', 'How many of those people who didn’t get sick just didn’t get sick because they were staying at home with their huge bag of Purell?\\\\nWells: So a challenge trial would speed up [the development process] because we would know exactly who was exposed?\\\\nHamblin: Right.', 'You could say, 70 percent of the people who got the vaccine were protected, and 30 percent of them got sick.', 'The problem is that would mean people got sick with a disease like this, and potentially even people died or had lasting complications.', 'There’s obviously a big ethical dilemma there.', 'But it could theoretically really speed up this process and make it more scientifically valid more quickly.', 'It’s not happening right now, but some people are proposing that it should.\\\\nStephen Thomas is the chief of infectious disease at SUNY Upstate Medical University.', 'His focus has been on researching vaccines.\\\\nWells: What is a challenge trial?', 'And should we do it?\\\\nStephen Thomas: This is where we give a healthy human being a mild form of the disease that we are trying to study so that we can hasten the development of a countermeasure drug or a vaccine, or we can fill in some critical gap in information that we are not able to fill using standard, benchtop science or small animals like rats and mice.', 'Challenge trials have been around for well over 100 years, and multiple diseases use challenge trials to support their development.', 'Each disease has particular reasons why human challenge makes sense.\\\\nWells: A challenge trial is where you vaccinate someone and then you expose them deliberately to the virus to see if they get it.', 'Is that right?\\\\nThomas: That’s the second step.', 'The first step is exposure without the vaccine.\\\\nHamblin: You have people who have volunteered to be infected.', 'How do you navigate that space about how someone can really consent to that, and who is willing, and why they would be willing to go through that?\\\\nThomas: There needs to be what we call “democratic deliberation.” There needs to be consensus among interested and disinterested parties, to include physicians and scientists and ethicists and regulators, that the disease that you’re talking about is appropriate for a human challenge.', 'You’re not going to have a human challenge model for a chronic, incurable disease.', 'You’re not going to have a human challenge trial where the risk to the individual is unacceptably high—that’s a whole discussion in and of itself.', 'You’re not going to have a human challenge model where the risk to others, not just the person who volunteers, but other people, is unacceptably high.\\\\nThen you propose a plan to the ethical review committees and the FDA.', 'Part of that plan is the informed-consent process, where you explain to the potential volunteers what the risks are and what the benefits are.', 'And oftentimes, the only benefit is that they will be advancing science and that they might be able, through their sacrifice, to help somebody else.\\\\nWells: Do you think it’s likely that this global pandemic will create the necessary urgency to make whatever risks worth it?', 'Do you think a challenge is going to happen?\\\\nThomas: There are too many unanswered questions about how we would actually do them.', 'For me personally, I absolutely think it should be thought about, and it should be discussed.', 'Challenge trials, in the right circumstances and under the right conditions, can be incredibly valuable.', 'I put my money where my mouth is, not just because I do challenge trials, but I have volunteered for a challenge trial.\\\\nHamblin: What did you get?\\\\nThomas: Malaria.', 'I was an infectious-disease fellow at the time, and I knew what I was going to do with my life.', 'And I said, “Someday you’re going to have to say that you stepped up and actually did what you’re asking other people to do.”\\\\nHamblin: How did they expose you?\\\\nThomas: I got three vaccinations over a period of weeks and then waited for a month.', 'And then I came back in, and they had five malaria-infected, very hungry mosquitoes in a little cup with a screen on top of it.', 'I put my arm on the top of the cup, and the mosquitoes came up and fed on my blood.', 'And then [the researchers] took the mosquitoes and took the salivary glands out of the mosquitoes, and they confirmed that each of the five mosquitoes had malaria.\\\\nWells: Did the vaccine work, or no?\\\\nThomas: As a matter of fact, it did.\\\\nWells: I imagined that there would be some highly scientific, tech-heavy process.', 'But no, we just take malaria-infected mosquitoes and have them bite you.\\\\nThomas: This is a great point that you raise, because ideally, you would want to deliver the virus the same exact way that somebody would be exposed.\\\\nHamblin: Oh no.', 'So for COVID-19, would people be coughed on?\\\\nThomas: That’s one of the questions: How are you going to deliver the virus?\\\\nWells: How much time do you save by going straight to a challenge?\\\\nThomas: If it worked really well, and the FDA believed that it worked really well, and the FDA said, “Listen, we will give you a license and allow you to sell your vaccine based on challenge data alone.” Then I think that’s one of the scenarios where we potentially could meet this warp-speed benchmark that has been put out there: [a vaccine] by the end of the year.\\\\nWells: I imagine even if we did challenge trials, it’s not guaranteed.', 'A lot of other things would have to go really, really right for us to have a vaccine widely available by the end of the year.\\\\nThomas: That’s correct.', 'Is it possible that we could be on the doorstep of having a vaccine by the end of the year?', 'Sure, it’s possible.', 'Is it likely?', 'No.', 'There’s a lot of

over Donald Trump is looming as an even greater factor in the 2020 presidential race—just as it was in 2016.\\\\nAmid the coronavirus outbreak, women generally express more financial strain and more concern about returning to their normal routines than men do.', 'And yet a wide array of recent polls shows that, especially among white voters, education remains the most important dividing line in reaction to Trump’s handling of the crisis.\\\\nThat pattern, in turn, signals that most voters are basing their assessments of Trump’s performance less on their actual daily experiences and more on their preexisting viewpoints about his tumultuous and norm-shattering presidency.', 'The biggest exception to that dynamic is older Americans, including older white voters, who polls suggest have clearly cooled on Trump as he and other Republicans have signaled— or flat out declared —that more deaths among seniors might be an acceptable price for reopening the economy.\\\\nBut mostly, the intense pressure of the pandemic appears to be fortifying, rather than fracturing, the long-standing divisions in the electorate that Trump has already widened since 2016, according to a wide range of previously unpublished polling data provided to The Atlantic.\\\\n“I think, generally, the last two months have been a good reminder that most people made up their minds about Donald Trump a long time ago, and nothing is going to change their opinion,” says the GOP consultant Alex Conant, a founding partner at Firehouse Strategies and the communications director for Senator Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign.', '“If they like him, everything he does just affirms why they like him, and if they don’t like him, everything he does reaffirms why they don’t like him.”\\\\nRead: The voters Trump needs most right now\\\\nThis dynamic is most clearly apparent when looking at the combined impact of race, education, and gender in driving views about the pandemic and the 2020 race between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.\\\\nAmong white voters, the pattern for decades has been that men generally vote more Republican than women, while voters with at least a four-year college degree lean more toward Democrats than those without advanced education.', 'The two antithetical poles of opinion: White men without a college degree consistently lean toward the GOP; white women with a college degree typically favor Democrats, with that tilt intensifying under Trump.\\\\nEvery data source on the 2016 election, such as the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations, showed Trump winning those men by enormous margins while losing the women by varying amounts depending on the survey.', 'In the 2018 House elections, blue-collar white men backed Republican candidates by about two to one, according to the exit polls , while college-educated white women gave Democrats a 20-percentage-point edge, by far the largest margin among those voters that the surveys have ever recorded.\\\\nThe two groups quickly retreated to their respective corners during the coronavirus crisis.', 'In last week’s national CNN poll , two-thirds of white men without a college degree said they approved of Trump’s handling of the outbreak, according to figures provided by the CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta.', 'In surveys from April 28 through May 18, the daily Navigator tracking poll , run by two Democratic polling firms, found that about three-fifths of these men approved of Trump’s response.', 'By contrast, in both the CNN and Navigator polls, 56 percent of college-educated white women disapproved of Trump’s performance.\\\\nThat gap applies to other recent measures of voter sentiment about the pandemic.', 'While 55 percent of blue-collar men said in the CNN poll that they are comfortable returning to their normal routines, 68 percent of college-educated white women said they are not.', 'In a Monmouth University poll released earlier this month, twice as many non-college-educated white men said Trump is providing helpful, rather than harmful, information on the virus; college-educated white women were more than three times as likely to say that his information was harmful rather than helpful, according to detailed results provided by the poll director Patrick Murray.\\\\nThe white voters who are more up for grabs for both parties are non-college-educated women and college-educated men.', 'In their response to the outbreak, these two groups offer a striking contrast—one that underscores the durability of the nation’s partisan chasm.\\\\nAccording to the exit polls, Republicans have carried both blocs in each presidential election since 2000.', 'All the major data sources about the 2016 results— including a study using voting records by the Pew Research Center and an analysis of voter data by the Democratic voter-targeting firm Catalist—found that Trump won non-college-educated white women by at least 20 percentage points.', 'The exit polls and Catalist showed Trump winning college-educated white men by about a dozen points (while Pew showed a narrow win for Hillary Clinton among them).\\\\nPerhaps not surprisingly, non-college-educated white women exhibit more strain over the outbreak than college-educated white men.', 'In the Navigator polling, these women were considerably more likely to say that they worry about falling behind on bills.', 'And while a slight majority of the men in the CNN survey said they are comfortable returning to their routines, three-fifths of the women said they are not.\\\\nRead: An unprecedented divide between red and blue America\\\\nEconomic and public-opinion analysts told me that those differences reflect the widely varying circumstances of the two groups before and during the outbreak: Women without a college degree always express elevated levels of financial pressure, and they are less likely than college-educated men to hold jobs that allow them to work from home.', 'Many of these women also face a greater burden in caring for young children or aging parents.\\\\nWomen, particularly those without college degrees, feel “the economic impact and also the caregiving burden … pretty acutely,” said Margie Omero, a pollster at the Democratic firm GBAO Strategies, which helps conduct the Navigator poll.', '“It’s not just about kids at home … It is also taking care of family members, worrying about visiting sick family members, a lot of the tough decisions that people are going to have to make about parents.”\\\\nAnd yet while these women report more unease over the pandemic, they are more likely than the men to praise Trump’s response to it.', 'In the Navigator polling, 56 percent of the women said they approved of Trump’s handling of the outbreak, compared with just 44 percent of the men.', '(The gap was smaller in the CNN poll, but the women were still more supportive.)', 'In yesterday’s Quinnipiac University national survey , non-college-educated white women were much less likely than the college-educated men to say that Trump has not done enough to respond.', 'In the early May Monmouth survey, a solid plurality of these women said Trump has provided mostly helpful information on the pandemic; among the men, twice as many said his information has been harmful rather than helpful.\\\\nThat last result may offer a clue to unlocking the broader trend—that education trumps gender in shaping attitudes about the president’s performance.', 'Operatives in both parties believe that Trump’s volatile and often-erratic pronouncements about the outbreak—such as suggesting the use of bleach and ultraviolet light to treat patients, and announcing that he is taking hydroxychloroquine—have compounded existing doubts among many well-educated white voters about his fitness for the presidency.\\\\n“There’s no question that Trump himself has reinforced the skepticism of what the people who did not like him … did not like about him before all of this,” said one GOP strategist, who requested anonymity to discuss Trump’s performance.', '“Now that’s on—to use another wonder drug—steroids.”\\\\nAll of these attitudes appear to be sifting into the 2020 presidential race in familiar patterns.\\\\nThe Monmouth survey this month, the NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll last month, and the Quinnipiac poll this week all showed Trump winning nearly two-thirds of non-college-educated white men and Biden capturing just less than two-thirds of college-educated white women.\\\\nDavid Frum: Trump has lost the plot\\\\nCompared with Trump’s 2016 performance, the 2018 exit polls generally showed the GOP suffering some erosion among blue-collar white women, with the party’s advantage slipping to 14 percentage points.', 'The latest round of surveys suggests that, among those women, Trump has stabilized at that diminished level, leading by roughly a dozen points (or slightly less) among them .', '(Only the latest Monmouth poll showed Trump nearing his 2016 margin, with a 23-percentage-point advantage.)', 'Recent state polls in the key Rust Belt battlegrounds have shown more favorable trends for Democrats: Fox News surveys last month in Pennsylvania and Michigan put Biden even among non-college-educated white women, and he led Trump among them in the latest Marquette University Law School poll in Wisconsin.\\\\nTrump is facing a tougher situation with college-educated white men.', 'The 2018 exit polls showed the GOP maintaining a narrow lead among them in the national House races.', 'But now most of the national surveys show them dividing almost exactly in half between the two candidates.', 'Biden leads narrowly with them in the latest Wisconsin survey, trails narrowly in the Pennsylvania poll, and runs further behind in the Michigan poll.', 'This week’s latest Arizona poll , from the nonpartisan survey firm OH Predictive Insights, also gave Biden a narrow lead with them.\\\\nAmong nonwhite voters, gender, not education, remains the key divide.', 'In 2016, Clinton won about four-fifths of nonwhite women with or without a college degree, and about two-thirds of the men in both groups, according to previously unpublished results provided by Edison Research.', 'Most preelection polls don’t have a large enough sample to analyze minority voters in such detail, but the huge Nationscape project , managed by UCLA and the Voter Study Group, does.', 'A compilation of its results from April 23 through May 13 show Trump again running slightly better among nonwhite men than women at each level of education.', 'The latest CNN poll showed nonwhite men giving Trump higher ratings than nonwhite women did on both the outbreak and his overall performance.\\\\nTaken together, all these results testify to the persistence of the country’s underlying fissures, which even an event as universal and wrenching as the outbreak does not appear to have materially changed.', 'Voters’ experiences during the crisis may be shaping their preferences about the November election much less than the ideological and cultural inclinations they brought into it.\\\\n“It is reinforcing what many people already think,” says the longtime Republican pollster Glen Bolger.', '“It’s not to say that nobody is experiencing it through their experience with the pandemic, but the majority are filtering it through their perception about Trump.”\\\\nMichael Steinberger: Why no one is calling on Trump to resign\\\\nThough that consistency remains the dominant pattern in polling through the crisis, two possible exceptions could tip the 2020 race at a time when the country remains closely divided.', 'Though the outbreak is spreading more broadly into Trump’s rural and small-town base, it has hit hardest in the big-city areas that were most skeptical of him from the outset.', 'That could widen Trump’s deficit in the most populous communities— he already lost America’s 100 largest counties by a combined total of about 15 million votes in 2016—and force him to squeeze even greater margins and higher turnout from smaller places.\\\\nThe second trend complicates the first for him: As I mentioned before, polling shows that the voting bloc that has most clearly moved away from Trump during the outbreak is older voters, including older whites.', 'Generally, small-town America is not only redder but also grayer.', 'If Trump slips at all with older voters, he will struggle to expand his margins in smaller communities.\\\\nIt’s remarkable how the outbreak has disrupted every aspect of American life without hugely reconfiguring the landscape for the 2020 presidential race.', 'But to the extent that it has shifted the terrain, it has left Trump facing an even narrower path to a second term.', 'And on that bumpy road, no rock looms before Trump more ominously than the persistent recoil from his values and performance among college-educated white voters of both genders.\\\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.', \"Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.\\\\nRonald Brownstein is a

Upton / Hulu\\\\nLink Copied\\\\nThis article contains spoilers for all 10 episodes of Hulu’s The Great.\\\\nRussia in the 18th century stood on the verge of disaster, with a war raging against Sweden and its cultural and intellectual progress failing to keep pace with Western Europe’s.\", 'Yet in Hulu’s historical satire The Great, Emperor Peter III (played by Nicholas Hoult) appears untroubled.', 'Surrounded by the comforts of royalty and the support of eager-to-please advisers, he treats the war as a nuisance, governing as a chore, and news of unrest as annoying falsehoods.', 'As he and his subjects claim, all is bliss in the court of Peter III.', 'When his new wife, Catherine (Elle Fanning), doesn’t approve of his lifestyle, he brushes her off with a casual retort: “It is hell to dwell.”\\\\nTruth has been similarly unwelcomed by today’s American leadership.', 'False claims downplaying the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and suggesting a swift end to the crisis have dominated Donald Trump’s press conferences .', 'Before states put social-distancing measures in place, he assured the nation that the virus would disappear, “like a miracle.” When it became evident that it wouldn’t, he suggested nonsensical fixes, such as injecting disinfectant into bodies as a cure.', 'This week, he revealed that he’s been taking hydroxychloroquine , the antimalarial drug medical experts have warned people against using because of its dangerous side effects.', 'Trump has treated facts as inconvenient, rejecting them in favor of minimizing the coronavirus’s impact.\\\\nThroughout The Great, the black comedy’s satirical tone captures how theatrical and nearsighted politics can become amid a crisis.', 'Peter’s and his allies’ denial of the truth—a deeply distressing truth, involving hundreds of thousands of lives lost—resembles the Trump administration’s shunning of medical expertise.', 'Ignorance paves the way for Peter III’s precious bliss; the president prefers to diminish the threat of the pandemic rather than confront the reality of its consequences.', 'For Peter, ruling is a spectacle, not a duty.', 'In the White House, briefings meant to inform the public have been molded into sales pitches and opportunities for the president to boast about his ratings.', 'Peter’s court may be an exaggeration of real-life Russian politics in the 18th century, but the character’s foolish governing strategy in the face of disaster reflects Trump’s.', 'Both men depend on the appeal of denial and ignorance.\\\\nTheirs is a leadership style that, during an unprecedented global disaster, has endured because the message it spreads—that nothing is wrong and all is bliss—is enticing.', 'The Great doesn’t spend much time outside of the palace gates to observe the full effects of the Russo-Swedish War, but the series makes clear that Peter’s advisers aid in his oblivion, looking the other way to stay in Peter’s good graces and retain their own high-status lifestyles.', 'The White House has found help from Trump’s base: Many of his supporters, who want their life to return to “normal,” free of the restrictions implemented during lockdown, have launched protests and flouted social-distancing guidelines.', 'When the facts of a crisis are too troublesome to bear, overlooking them in favor of maintaining the status quo can be tempting for those who run a statistically smaller risk of being directly affected in the first place.\\\\nCreated by Tony McNamara, a co-writer of The Favourite, and based on his 2008 play, The Great best captures this compulsion through the well-educated, sophisticated, and idealistic heroine Catherine, who, despite her role as the audience surrogate, falls under the same spell.', 'When she arrives in Russia from Prussia, she sees the court for what it is—an extravagant, vodka-soaked bubble insulated from horror—and plans a coup while pretending to support her husband.', 'But the more time she spends as empress, the more she conforms to and delights in the world around her.', 'She engages in petty squabbles with the women at court, accepts gifts from Peter (including a meeting with the French philosopher Voltaire, whom she admires), and falls in love with the man Peter offers to be her lover.', 'Midway through the season, she gets a chance to stage her coup earlier than planned, but at the last minute can’t follow through.', '“You criticize him for inaction,” scoffs her servant and ally, Marial (Phoebe Fox), “but you are just the same.”\\\\nCatherine isn’t the only one to blame for her paralysis, however.', 'The Great wryly observes how rhetoric plays a role in causing people to avoid unpleasant facts: When Peter does acknowledge the war, he speaks of the conflict as a chance to promote Russia’s glory and earn bragging rights if Russia wins—just as Trump has positioned America as the front-runner in testing for the coronavirus.', '(The country’s capacity is “unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close,” he erroneously boasted last week. )', 'The reality is dire for both: Russia has lost 180,000 men to an aimless war, and America counts more than 1.5 million infected .\\\\nLike the protesters who have reframed social-distancing restrictions as anti-American, the Archbishop (Adam Godley) twists Catherine’s original message—that her new home should be more open-minded to Western ideals—into a selfish and sanctimonious one.', 'Hardship helps the Russian people, he argues, and death is inevitable anyway, an assertion that should sound familiar to anyone who’s heard elected officials asking older, at-risk Americans to sacrifice themselves to save the economy.', '“People underestimate the joy in suffering,” the Archbishop explains to Catherine.', '“Walk through the pain, and on the other side, joy and purity.” Ignorance and inaction, in this sense, mutate into necessities for the good of the people.\\\\nOf course, such a call for endurance is easy for people like the Archbishop, who live in luxury at court, and the anti-social-distancing protesters, who are largely white and can afford to ignore the risk .', 'In both cases, nationalism outweighs the dangers of the crisis.', 'The might of Russia must prevail at all costs; America’s economy should not suffer just because lives are being lost.', 'The Great, for all its outrageous humor, recognizes the disturbing allure of such thinking.', 'McNamara—along with Fanning and Hoult, whose fine-tuned performances turn Peter and Catherine’s contentious relationship into a complex frenemy-ship—focuses on how power, and the comfort that comes with it, can corrupt them both.', 'By the end of the season, the audience roots for Catherine not because she’s well intentioned, but because she recognizes her privilege, grapples with her shortcomings, and reckons with how her circumstances shape her worldview.\\\\n“I’m fond of you,” Catherine admits to Peter in the finale, just before she begins her coup.', '“In some ways, you break my heart.” In her hand, she grasps the knife she plans to plunge into his neck.', 'He, not noticing anything, smiles warmly at her.', 'Therein lies a truth that The Great illustrates so well: Bliss founded in ignorance, as Peter is about to learn, is only borrowed bliss.\\\\nWe want to hear what you

to replace a mayor headed to prison for bribery and extortion.', '“By early March, it was clear that we wouldn’t have our big Saint Patrick’s Day parade.', 'That usually brings in a lot of money for businesses in town, and it struck me then that this crisis would affect us for a long time and hit city services.', 'A lot of things keyed off of that decision.”\\\\nCognetti soon closed city hall to

communities are those up against it already.', 'It’s parallel to who’s suffering from the virus.', 'The vulnerable places with vulnerable populations suffer most.” Nadol said that mid-size cities, many of which have big-city challenges without big-city revenues, will be among those that suffer the most in the near term.', 'Over time, the pain will spread wider and deeper.\\\\nThe fiscal crisis is building just as most cities in America are creating and adopting their budgets for the coming fiscal year.', 'No one knows what revenues will look like, or whether federal aid will materialize.', 'In a normal year, federal aid accounts for only a quarter of the trillions that state and local entities spend.', 'The rest comes from whatever state and local sources they tap to fill their

that we used to rely on, whether … it was [health], political coverage of the state, all the great investigative work … And then on the local level … what’s been wiped out is, you no longer have someone showing up for the routine government meetings, like the school board.”\\\\nThe shift to digital meetings and the disappearance of local news coverage are widening the gap between the affluent, highly educated, engaged voters who are able to make local governments respond to their desires and the rest of the population, who have greater needs but less leverage.', '“People can log in to public meetings from home,” Elorza said.', '“We will continue to invest in that.', 'But I am concerned less about the technology than about the equity and how we can support people without

involved by Zoom,” said Madaleno, whose county is among the best educated in the U.S. “In prior years, the budget hearings were full of teachers, parents, etc.', 'wearing T-shirts, holding signs.',

Kennedy proposed significant civil-rights legislation.\", 'In response, the word, which had primarily denoted the recoil of a fishing line, was repurposed, usually as “white backlash,” to refer to opposition to the increased pace of African American civil-rights activism or the Kennedy (and, after his assassination in November 1963, the Lyndon B. Johnson) administration’s legislative proposals and executive actions, or both.\\\\nIn 1966, a commentator, speaking of “the grand new word, backlash,” claimed without much exaggeration that “just about everything that happened could be (and was) attributed to some form of backlash.” The word came to stand for a topsy-turvy rebellion in which white people with relative societal power perceived themselves as victimized by what they described as overly aggressive African Americans demanding equal rights.', 'Backlash, as the New York Times columnist Tom Wicker wrote , “is nothing more nor less than white resentment of Negroes.”\\\\nMoving beyond an opposition to civil rights, the word backlash—less frequently qualified as “white”—quickly became a synonym for a new and growing conservative force, signifying a virulent counterreaction to all manner of social movements and cultural transformations that became central to American politics.', 'Over time, observers noted manifestations of this reaction in a “ Southern backlash ,” a “ male backlash ,” a “ heterosexual backlash ,” a “ property tax backlash ” and a “ backlash against environmentalists .” Just a month after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, a journalist described the United States as being in the midst of “a multitude of backlashes.” But as one commentator pointed out , “The word which gave rise to all sorts of other ‘lashes’ was coined in reference to white opposition to Negro gains.”\\\\nBacklash may have burst onto the scene as “ the word of the year in American politics ” in 1964, but it described one of the oldest and deepest patterns in American politics, one that is once again playing out today in the right-wing campaign against social distancing.', 'Backlashes appear as seemingly serial and discrete events—against the civil-rights movement in the 1960s, or the women’s movement in the ’70s, or the gay-rights movement in the ’90s.', 'But this obscures an underlying continuity: These individual backlashes are all instances of a reactionary tradition, one that is deeply woven into American political culture and that extends back to the era of Reconstruction, at least.', 'And the backlashes are powerful not only for the fury they represent, but in the fear they instill in political leaders, even progressives, who hesitate to push things “too far.”\\\\nDuring Reconstruction, opponents of the black-freedom struggle deployed preemptive, apocalyptic, slippery-slope arguments that have remained enduring features of backlash politics up to the present.', 'They treated federal support for African American civil rights, economic and social equality—however delayed, reluctant, underfunded, and incomplete it may have been—as a cataclysmic overreaction and framed it as a far more dangerous threat to liberty than the injustice it was designed to address.', 'In 1867, not even two years after ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle decried the placement of political power “in the hands of a property-less and ignorant class of the population,” and pronounced that “the pending Reconstruction scheme must be abandoned.”\\\\nSince then, such framing has done more than merely shape the politics of reaction in the United States; it has also constrained putatively supportive political leaders, who live in fear of setting off backlashes.', 'Responding to a moderate plan to enfranchise only free blacks in Louisiana in 1864, the Union general Nathaniel P. Banks, worrying about a negative response from the state’s whites, who were being defeated in the Civil War, said , “Revolutions which are not controlled and held within reasonable limits produce counter-revolution.” That obeisance to a defeated group in 1864 was an extreme version of a general pattern that has remained a hallmark of backlashes ever since: solicitousness to white fears.\\\\nFor many white backlashers in the 1960s, the era of what the historian C. Vann Woodward called the “second Reconstruction,” the first Reconstruction remained a negative model.', 'They viewed its reform as overly fast-paced, and felt that it foregrounded black civil rights at the cost of white people’s peace of mind.', 'They associated civil-rights activism with what popular historians and commentators of the day called the “ excesses ” of Reconstruction, by which they meant a combination of “militant” African American demands for basic equality with overweening, aggressive, and hasty federal action in support of interracial democracy.', 'Thurman Sensing of the Southern States Industrial Council, a conservative business group, described the civil-rights movement in 1966 as an effort to force “the Reconstruction of American customs,” showing the degree to which the post–Civil War campaign for racial equality remained a central metaphor for white backlashers.', 'The journalist in December 1963 who noted the political power of those opposed to “Negro pressure for equal opportunity and the Federal Government’s pace on the Civil Rights front,” could just as easily have been describing the origins of the counterrevolution of the 1870s.\\\\nThere was, then, nothing particularly novel about the constituent elements of white backlash to the civil-rights movement: its smoldering resentment, its belief that the movement was proceeding “too fast,” its demands for emotional and psychological sympathy, and its displacement of African Americans’ struggles with its own claims of grievance.\\\\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that the white backlash in this case was in place before the passage of the Civil Rights Act in July 1964.', 'The pattern is this: American reactionary politics is nearly always preemptive, predicting catastrophe and highlighting potential slippery slopes.', '“White backlash,” after all, got its name in 1963, just months after African Americans in Birmingham risked attacks from police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses in order to demand justice, and immediately after Kennedy mooted the idea of substantive legislation—both events taking place well before the Civil Rights Act became law.', 'What one reporter called “ white panic ” was driven by fears of “ favoritism ” and “ special privileges ” for African Americans—that white “workers would be forced out of their jobs to make way for Negroes,” as one article put it that year, when Jim Crow still prevailed.', '“Many of my people think the Negroes want to take over the country,” a midwestern Republican politician said in a Wall Street Journal article published on April 10 of the following year, still months before the Act’s passage.', '“They think there are things in the bill that just aren’t there, like forced sales of housing to Negroes and stuff like that.” White backlashers imagined coercion where it did not exist.', 'They embraced a lexicon and posture of victimization that hearkened back to the era of Reconstruction and anticipated the deceiving, self-pitying MAGA discourse that drives reactionary politics in Donald Trump’s America.\\\\nResidents of Levittown, Pennsylvania, are shown during a rally on August 17, 1957, to protest plans by William Myers, a black man, to move into a home in the all-white community of 60,000 people.\\\\xa0 (Bill Ingraham / AP)\\\\nSince Reconstruction, many backlash campaigns have imposed a politics of white fragility and frustration onto racial-equality struggles.', 'Reporting on the “hate vote” in The Saturday Evening Post, in October 1964, one month before the presidential election, Ben H. Bagdikian highlighted the “churning, emotional conflict within each voter,” by which he meant white people.', 'He noted that the backlashers “are not against a better life for the Negro, but they are strongly against this being achieved at the cost of white tranquility.” The elevation of “tranquility” over equal justice for all was a hallmark of backlash discourse, which ranked white feelings over black rights.\\\\nBacklashers understood civil rights as zero-sum, and therefore treated campaigns for African American equality as an inexcusable undermining of what they saw as deserved white privileges and prerogatives.', 'A New York Times poll revealed , in condensed form, the emotional landscape of the white backlash: “Northern white urbanites have no sympathy for the Negro’s plight, and believe the Civil Rights movement has gone too far, while a considerable percentage believes Negroes ‘don’t appreciate what we’re doing for them.’” The extension of sympathy, such as being in favor of a “better life for the Negro,” was, then, conditional on personal convenience and easily withdrawn.', '“In general, the persons interviewed were mildly in favor of a better break for Negroes—as long as it wouldn’t affect them personally,” the reporter Dave Allbaugh observed in 1963.\\\\n“Too far.', 'Too fast.” \\\\xa0Although Kennedy’s proposal came more than 80 years after the last significant piece of civil-rights legislation was passed in 1875, backlashers often spoke in these terms, deputizing themselves as judges of the proper scope and pace of social change.', 'On February 23, 1964, in The Washington Post, the journalist Robert Baker described the backlash as white “resentment of Negro boycotts and dramatic protests” that they had determined to be “ill-advised and unreasonable,” which suggested that white critics should determine the standard for advisable and reasonable protest.', 'They charged African American protesters—who sought to end nearly a century of Jim Crow segregation, lynching, and disenfranchisement, as well as job and housing discrimination—with moving “ too militantly.', '” To backlashers, the potential passage of the Civil Rights Act marked the dangerous acceleration of a process that needed to proceed more deliberately, according to their schedule and on their terms.', '“There is wide agreement on Capitol Hill that the polls are right in saying that the white majority believes that the Negro is pushing too far, too fast and that the Kennedy administration is trying to do too much to help the Negro,” Chalmers M. Roberts of The Washington Post wrote in October 1963, in the first story of a three-part report on “the current status of the racial issue in America.” A few months earlier, in his “ Letter From a Birmingham Jail, ” Martin Luther King Jr. criticized white moderates (“who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation”) on the ground that their charges of excessive haste were a cover for the racist status quo: “For years now I have heard the word ‘Wait!’ It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity.', 'This ‘Wait’ has almost always meant ‘Never.’ We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ‘justice too long delayed is justice denied.’”\\\\nWhite backlashers did not just wallow in their fear, anger, and resentment.', 'In broadcasting these feelings widely, they shaped the limits of acceptable reform.', 'Recommending a “ go-slow course ,” they could extend sympathy or not, and sought to determine when equal rights crossed the line into “special privileges.” A reporter noted “the apprehension of suburbanites and others in white neighborhoods that their residential areas will face an influx of Negroes.” In this worldview, whites presented themselves as victims, the crimes perpetrated against them by campaigns for equality were anxiety, inconvenience, and fear.', 'Long before the passage of the Civil Rights Act, a politician told the Post’s Roberts in October 1963, “For the first time, I’m getting mail from white people saying, ‘Wait a minute, we’ve got rights too.’” The “too” was especially telling because at that time a large number of African Americans still lacked federal protection for basic civil and voting rights.\\\\nThe “white backlash” thus produced a politics of displacement, shifting the focus from those denied equality under the law and demanding justice to those who imagined threat or inconvenience in the possibility of social change.', 'In September 1963, the Dayton Daily News highlighted the “Northern whites who are growing increasingly jittery as the wave of Negro protest washes home on their doorstep,” and in November of that same year, the Los Angeles Times noted “the welter of ill-feeling generated by Negro marches and sit-ins.” The feelings that mattered were those of white people.\\\\nThe reporting on the backlash foregrounded white fears and anxieties in a way that coverage of African Americans rarely did.', 'Jerry Landauer’s April 1964 report for the Wall Street Journal highlighted white people’s “emotion-laden struggle,” appropriating even the word struggle to describe the psychological challenges for white Americans of adjusting to the possibility of racial equality.', 'Landauer noted “the intense resentment of large blocs of whites in the North,” which was amplified by the likelihood that the Civil Rights Act might actually become law (which it did in July).', '“To them, the bill has become a symbol of fear—fear of losing jobs to Negroes; fear that neighborhood schools will be flooded by Negro kids ‘bussed in’ from across town; fear that homeowners will be forced to sell, if they wish to sell at all, to Negro newcomers.” These were fears of the consequences of African American equality, framed as unfair victimization.\\\\nThroughout what we might call the “backlash era,” African Americans offered a clear-eyed analysis and robust critique of backlashes and white defenses of them, taking them to be, as the ex-baseball star and longtime activist Jackie Robinson put it in a 1966 New York Amsterdam News article, “a great big fat alibi for bigotry.” Whereas many white observers in the early 1960s highlighted the novelty of white backlash, Martin Luther King Jr. more accurately called it “ a new name for an old phenomenon ” that “ had always existed underneath and sometimes on the surface of American life.', '”\\\\xa0 Langston Hughes wrote a poem, “The Backlash Blues,” which Nina Simone later set to music and recorded.\\\\nMembers of the Arkansas-based white-pride organization White Revolution protest on May 21, 2005.', '(David S.

Johnson won an overwhelming election victory, leading him to speculate that a “frontlash” of civil-rights support was far more significant than what he labeled the “so-called backlash,” which suffered crushing double defeats that year.', 'Johnson predicted at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City that “for every backlash that the Democrats lose, we pick up three frontlash [votes],” and his shellacking of Barry Goldwater on Election Day seemed to prove him correct.\\\\nBut, as Johnson was also well aware, the forces of backlash were far from defeated.', '“I think we just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come,” LBJ told Bill Moyers, his press aide, shortly after he signed the Civil Rights Act.', 'With the hindsight that history offers, we can see that Goldwater’s campaign was less a sign of the backlash’s vanquishing than a harbinger of modern conservatism.', 'In 1966, the influential columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak called white backlash “a permanent feature of the political scene,” where it has remained ever since.\\\\nUsing the same phrase that General Banks had employed a century earlier, but to different purposes, a columnist wrote that the proper way to understand white backlash was as “a counter-revolution against the black man.” Counterrevolution is a phrase that Americans rarely use to describe our politics.', 'But it is not unfair or inaccurate to apply this label to white backlash, whose explicit goal was to slow or halt the civil-rights revolution.\\\\nThe backlashers lost a number of key political battles in the 1960s, the decade in which they got their name.', 'From Reconstruction to the New Deal, they had been vanquished before, and they’ve been defeated more recently, too, in a variety of areas—LBGTQ rights, for example.', 'But both before and since, the preemptive politics of grievance and anti-egalitarianism they championed, whereby the psychology of privilege takes center

adopt the Green New Deal, it “will empower climate-change skeptics, weaken the hand of would-be compromisers in the GOP” and “possibly help Donald Trump win re-election.” In this way, backlash

reaction against the women’s movement—which, as Mary Wiegers wrote in 1970, faced a “built-in backlash” before it even got started—that culminated in the successful campaign against the Equal Rights

have been reflected in the genre of “angry white male” movies, including Falling Down and Gran Torino.', 'More recently, and more consequentially, these forces helped elect Donald Trump, who framed

disease caused by the virus: State governments consider a positive viral test to be the only way to confirm a case of COVID-19.', 'Antibody tests, by contrast, use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past.\\\\nA negative test result means something different for each test.', 'If somebody tests negative on a viral test, a doctor can be relatively confident that they are not sick right now; if somebody tests negative on an antibody test, they have probably never been infected with or exposed to the coronavirus.', '(Or they may have been given a false result—antibody tests are notoriously less accurate on an individual level than viral tests.)', 'The problem is that the CDC is clumping negative results from both tests together in its public reporting.\\\\nRead: Pools will test the limits of social distancing\\\\nMixing the two tests makes it much harder to understand the meaning of positive tests, and it clouds important information about the U.S. response to the pandemic, Jha said.', '“The viral testing is to understand how many people are getting infected, while antibody testing is like looking in the rearview mirror.', 'The two tests are totally different signals,” he told us.', 'By combining the two types of results, the CDC has made them both “uninterpretable,” he said.\\\\nThe public-radio station WLRN, in Miami, first reported that the CDC was mixing viral and antibody test results.', 'Pennsylvania’s and Maine’s decisions to mix the two tests have not been previously reported.\\\\nKristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the CDC, told us that the inclusion of antibody data in Florida is one reason the CDC has reported hundreds of thousands more tests in Florida than the state government has.', 'The agency hopes to separate the viral and antibody test results in the next few weeks, she said in an email.\\\\nBut until the agency does so, its results will be suspect and difficult to interpret, says William Hanage , an epidemiology professor at Harvard.', 'In addition to misleading the public about the state of affairs, the intermingling “makes the lives of actual epidemiologists tremendously more difficult.”\\\\n“Combining a test that is designed to detect current infection with a test that detects infection at some point in the past is just really confusing and muddies the water,” Hanage told us.\\\\nRead: Why the coronavirus is so confusing\\\\nThe CDC stopped publishing anything resembling a complete database of daily test results on February 29.', 'When it resumed publishing test data last week, a page of its website explaining its new COVID Data Tracker said that only viral tests were included in its figures.', '“These data represent only viral tests.', 'Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data,” the page said as recently as May 18 .\\\\nYesterday, that language was changed .', 'All reference to disaggregating the two different types of tests disappeared.', '“These data are compiled from a number of sources,” the new version read.', 'The text strongly implied that both types of tests were included in the count, but did not explicitly say so.\\\\nThe CDC’s data have also become more favorable over the past several days.', 'On Monday, a page on the agency’s website reported that 10.2 million viral tests had been conducted nationwide since the pandemic began, with 15 percent of them—or about 1.5 million—coming back positive.', 'But yesterday, after the CDC changed its terms, it said on the same page that 10.8 million tests of any type had been conducted nationwide.', 'Yet its positive rate had dropped by a percent.', 'On the same day it expanded its terms, the CDC added 630,205 new tests, but it added only 52,429 positive results.\\\\nThis is what concerns Jha.', 'Because antibody tests are meant to be used on the general population, not just symptomatic people, they will, in most cases, have a lower percent-positive rate than viral tests.', 'So blending viral and antibody tests “will drive down your positive rate in a very dramatic way,” he said.\\\\nThe absence of clear national guidelines has led to widespread confusion about how testing data should be reported.', 'Pennsylvania reports negative viral and antibody tests in the same metric, a state spokesperson confirmed to us on Wednesday.', 'The state has one of the country’s worst outbreaks, with more than 67,000 positive cases.', 'But it has also slowly improved its testing performance, testing about 8,000 people in a day.', 'Yet right now it is impossible to know how to interpret any of its accumulated results.\\\\nRead: Should you get an antibody test?\\\\nTexas, where the rate of new COVID-19 infections has stubbornly refused to fall, is one of the most worrying states (along with Georgia).', 'The Texas Observer first reported last week that the state was lumping its viral and antibody results together.', 'On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott denied that the state was blending the results, but the Dallas Observer reports that it is still doing so.\\\\nWhile the number of tests per day has increased in Texas, climbing to more than 20,000, the combined results mean that the testing data are essentially uninterpretable.', 'It is impossible to know the true percentage of positive viral tests in Texas.', 'It is impossible to know how many of the 718,000 negative results were not meant to diagnose a sick person.', 'The state did not return a request for comment, nor has it produced data describing its antibody or viral results separately.', '(Some states, following guidelines from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, report antibody-test positives as “probable” COVID-19 cases without including them in their confirmed totals.', ')\\\\nGeorgia is in a similar situation.', 'It has also seen its COVID-19 infections plateau amid a surge in testing.', 'Like Texas, it reported more than 20,000 new results on Wednesday, the majority of them negative.', 'But because, according to The Macon Telegraph , it is also blending its viral and antibody results together, its true percent-positive rate is impossible to know.', '(The governor’s office did not return a request for comment.', ')\\\\nThese results damage the public’s ability to understand what is happening in any one state.', 'On a national scale, they call the strength of America’s response to the coronavirus into question.', 'The number of tests conducted nationwide each day has more than doubled in the past month, rising from about 147,000 a month ago to more than 413,000 on Wednesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, which compiles data reported by state and territorial governments.', 'In the past week, the daily number of tests has grown by about 90,000.\\\\nAt the same time, the portion of tests coming back positive has plummeted, from a seven-day average of 10 percent at the month’s start to 6 percent on Wednesday.\\\\n“The numbers have outstripped what I was expecting,” Jha said.', '“My sense is people are really surprised that we’ve moved as much as we have in such a short time period.', 'I think we all expected a move and we all expected improvement, but the pace and size of that improvement has been a big surprise.”\\\\nThe intermingling of viral and antibody tests suggests that some of those gains might be illusory.', 'If even a third of the country’s gain in testing has come by expanding antibody tests, not viral tests, then its ability to detect an outbreak is much smaller than it seems.', 'There is no way to ascertain how much of the recent increase in testing is from antibody tests until the most populous states in the country—among them Texas, Georgia, and Pennsylvania—show their residents everything in the data.\\\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.', 'Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.\\\\nAlexis C.

summer’s highlight—a natural gathering place and a chance to exercise when it’s too hot to do much of anything else.', 'And indeed, certain pools and water parks in states such as Texas and Georgia have made plans to open this summer, though some will operate at reduced capacity.\\\\nEarlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered some suggestions for how pools can stay open without turning into viral hot spots.', 'But not only do the guidelines seem far-fetched; if followed, they are likely to make for a somewhat strange pool season.', 'For example, the agency said, pool operators could space lounge chairs six feet apart and disinfect them regularly.', 'They could encourage people to wear masks when they’re outside the water—tan lines be damned.', 'And

people living at odd- and even-numbered addresses to come to the pool on different days, to facilitate social distancing.', 'Pools could set up a reservation system for lap lanes and keep people from loitering around the pool.', 'Some cities are opening just their largest pools —perhaps because their bigger size would better allow people to spread out.\\\\nBut these restrictions come with their own drawbacks.', 'People might get frustrated that their designated pool “day” falls on a rainy Sunday rather than a sunny Saturday.', 'And social distancing at pools can be hard to enforce.', 'It’s not really possible to get small kids—some of the most enthusiastic pool-goers—to keep their distance from one another.', 'At the pool, even normal adult behavior tends to devolve into joyous anarchy:

Graham: This is what an unleashed Trump looks like\\\\nSecond, even if Trump writes off his threats as bluster—he often claims that his gaffes were really “sarcasm” or jokes , most recently and implausibly when he suggested using disinfectants or UV light inside the body to kill the coronavirus—legions of executive-branch employees are ready to interpret his whims and try to act on them.', 'Like an earlier ill-tempered, ginger-haired nepotistic ruler , Trump need only ask offhand for appointees to rid him of a turbulent state .\\\\nAs my colleague Jeffrey Goldberg has noted, Trump runs the executive branch with a Mafia mentality , and is careful to never be too explicit, even when his intentions are clear.', 'Consider again the impeachment.', 'Ambassador Gordon Sondland clearly understood Trump to demand that Ukraine announce an investigation into the Bidens as part of a quid pro quo, but Trump countered that he never told Sondland it was a “quid pro quo.” Trump’s treatment of officials in the aftermath of his impeachment also demonstrated to appointees that those who follow the law but buck Trump’s whims are vulnerable to public attack and ouster, while those who break the law but indulge the president will be rewarded and protected.\\\\nThis morning’s tweets are, it is true, just more wild rambling from the president.', 'That doesn’t mean they can’t also be a grave threat to the integrity of the 2020 election.\\\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.', \"Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.\\\\nDavid A. Graham is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\\\\nConnect\\\\n', 'How the Pandemic Will End\\\\nI spoke with two dozen experts who agreed that in the absence of a vaccine, the patchwork will continue.\", 'Cities that thought the worst had passed may be hit anew.', 'States that had lucky escapes may find themselves less lucky.', 'The future is uncertain , but Americans should expect neither a swift return to normalcy nor a unified national experience, with an initial spring wave, a summer lull, and a fall resurgence.', '“The talk of a second wave as if we’ve exited the first doesn’t capture what’s really happening,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\nWhat’s happening is not one crisis, but many interconnected ones.', 'As we shall see, it will be harder to come to terms with such a crisis.', 'It will be harder to bring it to heel.', 'And it will be harder to grapple with the historical legacies that have shaped today’s patchwork.\\\\nI.', 'The Patchwork Experience\\\\nA patchwork pandemic is psychologically perilous.', 'The measures that most successfully contain the virus—testing people, tracing any contacts they might have infected, isolating them from others—all depend on “how engaged and invested the population is,” says Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins.', '“If you have all the resources in the world and an antagonistic relationship with the people, you’ll fail.” Testing matters only if people agree to get tested.', 'Tracing succeeds only if people pick up the phone.', 'And if those fail, the measure of last resort—social distancing—works only if people agree to sacrifice some personal freedom for the good of others.', 'Such collective actions are aided by collective experiences.', 'What happens when that experience unravels?\\\\n“We had a strong sense of shared purpose when everything first hit,” says Danielle Allen, a political scientist at Harvard.', 'But that communal mindset may dissipate as the virus strikes one community and spares another, and as some people hit the beaches while others are stuck at home.', 'Patchworks of risk and response “will make it really hard for the public to get a crisp understanding of what’s happening,” Rivers says.\\\\nIn one future scenario, the nation splinters.', 'When national news diverges from local reality, “suspicions about whether the epidemic was a hoax will find fertile ground in places with a more ambiguous experience of the disease,” says Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University.', 'Confused people will retreat to the comfort of preexisting ideologies.', 'The White House’s baseless attempts to claim victory will further divide the already fragmented states of America.', '“In the face of medical uncertainty, people make decisions by returning to their own groups, which are very polarized,” says Elaine Hernandez, a sociologist at Indiana University Bloomington.', '“They’ll want to avoid being stigmatized, so they’ll follow what people in their networks are doing [even if] they don’t really want to go out.”\\\\nRead: Why the coronavirus hits kids and adults so differently\\\\nPrevention is physically rewarding in the long term, but not emotionally rewarding in the short term.', 'People who stay home won’t feel a pleasant dopamine kick from their continued health.', 'Those who flock together will feel hugs and sunshine.', 'The former will be tempted to join the latter.', 'The media could heighten that temptation by offering what Lincoln calls “disparity in spectacle.” Fringe exceptions like anti-lockdown protests and packed restaurants , she says, are more dramatic and telegenic than people responsibly staying at home, and so more likely to be covered.', 'The risk is that rare acts of incaution will seem like normal behavior.\\\\n“There’s a natural saturation point for images of health systems in crisis,” Lincoln adds, and newly overwhelmed hospitals might be ignored in favor of fresher narratives.', 'The local media are better positioned to pick up the nuances of a patchwork story, but of the counties that had reported cases of COVID-19 by early April, 37 percent had lost their local newspaper in the past 15 years.', 'If the virus does indeed resurge and states need to shut down again, people may not comply, because they’ll be misinformed and distrustful.\\\\nA second future is also possible.', '“When this outbreak began in China, everyone said, Thank God it’s not here,” Jha says.', '“It moved to Western Europe and people said, They have government-run health care; that won’t happen here.', 'Then it hit New York and Seattle, and people said, It’s the coasts.', 'At every moment, it’s more tempting to define the other who is suffering, as opposed to seeing the commonalities we all share.” But as the virus spreads, Americans may run out of others to discriminate against.', '“Crises are political only until they are personal,” wrote the journalist Elaina Plott, in a piece about a Louisiana woman who convinced her conservative friends to take the coronavirus seriously after her own husband fell sick.', 'Similarly, President Donald Trump’s claims that the virus will go away on its own will ring false to supporters who know someone fighting for breath.\\\\nThere are signs that this is happening.', 'While Trump’s popularity predictably surged during the crisis, his “rally around the flag” boost was a blip compared with the prolonged peaks of other leaders.', 'Polls have also shown that pandemic partisanship is narrowing, with Democrats and Republicans more united in how seriously they view the threat.', 'Beth Redbird, a sociologist at Northwestern University, has been surveying 200 people a day since mid-March, and “ 70 to 75 percent of people support most social-distancing measures,” she says.', '“Those are really large numbers in a society where 52 percent is often viewed as huge support.', 'We rarely see that outside of authoritarian polling.', 'Americans are by and large reading information in a very similar way.”\\\\nEconomic indicators support this view.', 'Even in conservative states, activity plummeted before leaders closed businesses, and hasn’t rebounded since restrictions were lifted.', 'As such, Redbird doesn’t share the widely held fear that Americans have become inured to social distancing and will refuse to suffer through it again.', 'The bigger risk, she says, is that demoralizing bouts of shutdowns and reopenings will nix any prospect of economic recovery.', '“You only get to say Go out, trust me once,” she says.', '“They won’t believe you the second time.”\\\\nBoth possible futures are confounded by three aspects of COVID-19 that make the pandemic hard to grasp, and that are amplified by the patchwork effect.', 'First, the disease progresses slowly.', 'It seems to take an average of four or five days , and a maximum of 14, for an infected person to show symptoms.', 'Those symptoms can take even longer to become severe enough for a hospital stay, and longer still to turn fatal.', 'This means that new infections can take weeks to manifest in regional statistics.', 'May’s declining cases are the result of April’s physical distancing, and the consequences of May’s reopenings won’t be felt until June at the earliest.', 'This long gap between actions and their consequences makes it easy to learn the wrong lessons.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\nRead: Why some people get sicker than others\\\\nSecond, the pandemic is shaped by many factors.', 'Social distancing matters, but so do testing capacity, population density, age structure, wealth, societal collectivism, and luck.', 'Many countries that successfully controlled the coronavirus used masks ; New Zealand did not.', 'Many had decisive leaders; Hong Kong did not .', 'It is easy to look at a patchwork and create just-so stories about why one place succumbed while another triumphed.', 'But no single factor can explain differences across nations or regions.\\\\nThird, the disease spreads unevenly.', 'Some cases infect no one, and others infect many.', 'In Washington State, a choir member infected 51 fellow singers during a few hours of rehearsal.', 'In Ghana, a worker in a fish factory infected 533 colleagues.', 'These “super-spreader events,” which are rare but pivotal, become especially important when cases dip.', 'They mean that an untroubled region may continue that way for some time, but that once cases start growing, they can really grow.\\\\nIf a state reopens and sees no immediate spike in cases, is that because it was justified, because insufficient time has passed, because other things went right, or because unlucky super-spreader events haven’t yet happened?', 'In a patchwork, these questions will be asked millions of times over, and many answers will be wrong.\\\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is not a hurricane or some other disaster that will come and go, signaling an obvious moment when recovery can begin.', 'It is not like the epidemics of fiction, which get worse until, after some medical breakthrough, they get better.', 'It is messier, patchier, and thus harder to predict, control, or understand.', '“We’re in that zone that we don’t see movies made about,” says Lindsay Wiley, a professor of public-health law at American University.\\\\nII.', 'The Patchwork Response\\\\nA patchwork was inevitable, especially when a pandemic unfolds over a nation as large as the U.S.', 'But the White House has intensified it by devolving responsibility to the states.', 'There is some sense to that.', 'American public health works at a local level, delivered by more than 3,000 departments that serve specific cities, counties, tribes, and states.', 'This decentralized system is a strength: An epidemiologist in rural Minnesota knows the needs and vulnerabilities of her community better than a federal official in Washington, D.C.\\\\nBut in a pandemic, the actions of 50 uncoordinated states will be less than the sum of their parts.', 'Only the federal government has pockets deep enough to fund the extraordinary public-health effort now needed.', 'Only it can coordinate the production of medical supplies to avoid local supply-chain choke points, and then ensure that said supplies are distributed according to need, rather than influence.', 'Instead, Trump has repeatedly told governors to procure their own tests and medical supplies .\\\\nRead: Trump i s putting himself at risk for COVID-19\\\\nMichael Kilkenny of the Cabell-Huntington Health Department, in West Virginia, says his state found itself short on swabs, disinfectant, and protective equipment; unable to compete in the global market; and abandoned by the White House.', '“It felt terrible,” he says.', '“We’ve been making homemade masks, or using bleach solutions.', 'We had to fend for ourselves.” While reporting on pandemics in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, I heard health-care workers repeatedly joke that the 15th article of the country’s constitution is “Débrouillez-vous”—French for “Figure it out yourself.” It’s a droll resignation that when resources are scarce, the government won’t fix your problems, and it’s on you to make do.', 'The U.S., a country that’s more than 400 times wealthier, has seemingly adopted “Débrouillez-vous” as national policy.\\\\nEven health officials in well-off states aren’t comfortable with a situation in which preparedness has more to do with wealth and connections than need.', '“We have everything we need,” says Angela Dunn, the state epidemiologist for Utah, where Governor Gary Herbert moved quickly to buy and secure tests and supplies.', '“But we did it in a very capitalistic way, and that’s not the best way to deal with a pandemic.” States have tried to level the playing field on their own.', 'Wyoming ended up with few cases but a glut of testing reagents, which it provided to Colorado and Utah when those states saw spikes, Dunn says.', '“There’s a small barter system, but it’s not sustainable and it doesn’t work at scale,” she says.', '“I don’t know if Colorado is lacking supplies.', 'If they have a huge spike, that’ll impact Utah.', 'It’s in our interests to make sure everyone’s protected, and without federal coordination, that’s hard to do.”\\\\nIn some cases, the federal government has actively undermined the states.', 'Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, tried to buy protective equipment, but was thrice outbid by the federal government; he ended up using the New England Patriots’ jet to fly 1.2 million masks over from China, many of which turned out to be faulty.', 'When Larry Hogan, Maryland’s Republican governor, procured 500,000 tests from South Korea , he kept them guarded in an undisclosed location so they wouldn’t be seized by the feds.', 'This is not federalism working as intended , where different tiers of government work together.', 'Instead of devolving control to the states, the Trump administration has ceded the U.S. to the virus.\\\\nThe U.S. now heads into summer only slightly more prepared to handle the pandemic that cost it so dearly in the spring.', 'According to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, the U.S. is now testing 366,000 people a day—a record high.', 'But experts estimate that the country needs 500,000 to several million daily tests.', 'Here, too, a patchwork is apparent.', 'An analysis by NPR and Harvard’s Global Health Institute showed that in early May, only nine states were doing sufficient testing, and another 31 weren’t even halfway to their requisite threshold.\\\\n“I would have hoped for more, considering the cost of that time,” says Natalie Dean, a statistician at the University of Florida.', 'Stay-at-home orders were necessary but ruinous, economically and emotionally.', 'Their purpose was to buy time for the country to catch its breath, steel its hospitals, and roll out a public-health plan capable of quashing the virus.', 'Many such plans exist.', 'Umpteen think tanks and academics have produced their own road maps for dialing society back up.', 'These vary in their details, but are united in at least having some.', 'By contrast, the Trump administration’s guidelines for “ opening up America again ” are so bereft of operational specifics that they’re like a cake recipe that simply reads, “Make cake.”\\\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prepared a more detailed guide but was blocked from releasing it by the White House, according to an Associated Press report.', 'The guidance it has released seems carefully worded to avoid the term guidelines, as if it’s “trying to fly under the radar,” Wiley says.', '“The abdication of federal responsibility has left states with little choice but to ease the most disruptive physical-distancing measures without the testing data that would make us more confident that cases won’t rapidly surge.” (The CDC finally and quietly released a slightly abridged version of its fuller report on Tuesday.', ')\\\\nRead: There’s one big reason the U.S. economy can’t reopen\\\\nThe Trump administration “isn’t known for consistency of messaging, so we’ll never put our full faith in that,” says Kilkenny of West Virginia.', '“We pretty much ran our own state here.” At the time of this writing, only five states and the District of Columbia are still under some form of lockdown.', 'A few, such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Montana, eased restrictions after their caseloads had fallen to low single digits.', 'Idaho is reopening cautiously , despite being one of the less affected states.\\\\nGeorgia went all in on April 24, reopening gyms, restaurants, theaters, salons, and bowling alleys at a point when it had five of the 10 counties with the highest COVID-19 death rates nationwide, and was testing just a fifth as many people as it needed to.', 'By contrast, Utah revived businesses a week later, when it had more than enough tests for everyone with symptoms, all their contacts, high-risk groups, and even random slices of the populace.', 'Still, Dunn, the state epidemiologist, is nervous.', '“If we could stick it out for even a couple more months of stricter social distancing, it would do us a world of benefit,” she says.', '“There are embers everywhere, and they could ignite any moment.” Some states never put their fires out at all: Texas, Alabama, Kansas, Arizona, Mississippi, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and others all reopened while cases were still rising.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\n“It’s inevitable that we’ll see stark increases in infections in the next weeks,” says Oscar Alleyne of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.', 'The experiences of other countries support that view.', 'Success stories like South Korea, China , Singapore , and Lebanon all had to renew or extend social-distancing measures to deal with new bursts of cases.', 'And they had all restrained the virus to a much greater extent than the U.S., which despite having just 4 percent of the world’s population has 31 percent of its confirmed COVID-19 cases (1.5 million) and 28 percent of its confirmed deaths (92,000).\\\\nIn a connected country, flare-ups that begin in reckless states can easily spread into more cautious ones.', 'Cellphone data, for example, reveal that after Georgia businesses revved back into action, more than 60,000 extra visitors poured in from neighboring states every day.', 'Genetic studies show the risks of such movements.', 'By using patterns of mutations to reconstruct the pandemic’s path, researchers have shown that most of New York’s cases likely stemmed from one introduction from Europe in mid-February.', 'Most of Louisiana’s cases arose from just a couple of introductions from within the U.S. Just a few travelers can spark substantial outbreaks in new places.\\\\nTo mitigate such risks, about two dozen states have asked out-of-town arrivals to self-quarantine for 14 days.', 'But tighter restrictions would be a logistical and legal nightmare.', 'States can regulate what happens within their borders, but have limited powers to control travel across them.', 'Congress could potentially do so , but it’s unclear if the courts would uphold any restrictions.', 'The right to travel is supported by Supreme Court precedents, but in 1965, the Court ruled that said right “does not mean that areas ravaged by flood, fire or pestilence cannot be quarantined” if unlimited travel would jeopardize the safety of the nation.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\nAnne Applebaum: The rest of the world is laughing at Trump\\\\nLegality aside, domestic-travel bans are of limited use.', 'Even China’s extraordinary quarantine of Wuhan merely delayed the virus from reaching other parts of the mainland by three to five days .', 'Much like social distancing, such measures only buy time.', 'The better strategy is not to try and prevent the virus from traveling, but to build a public-health system nimble enough to catch it when it arrives.', 'Don’t build one big wall; instead, ready a thousand nets.\\\\nIn this, the U.S. is also behind.', 'Prevented health threats are less visible than present ones, which means that successful public-health departments tragically make the case for their own diminishment.', 'Since 2008, underfunded local departments have lost more than 50,000 jobs.', 'Even now, Cincinnati’s health department has furloughed 36 percent of its staff .', '“How can you have a system that’s meant to be at the front line of the defense while it’s losing the staff it needs?” Alleyne asks.\\\\nSome states are trying to make up for these losses by hiring battalions of contact tracers .', 'These people will call every infected person, talk through their needs, ask for names of anyone they’ve had close or prolonged contact with in the past two days, and call those contacts, too.', 'The process isn’t complicated, but it is laborious.', 'Experts have estimated that the U.S. needs 100,000 to 300,000 contact tracers, and the nation has been slow to recruit them.', 'Selena Simmons-Duffin of NPR reported that only North Dakota had recruited enough as of May 7, although six more states and the District of Columbia were set to.\\\\nThings are improving, though.', 'When Danielle Allen of Harvard canvassed several mayors in mid-April, they weren’t taking contact tracing seriously.', 'When she spoke with them again in May, “they were on top of it,” she says.', '“I was blown away by how much changed in three weeks.” New York State alone is planning to hire 6,000 to 17,000 contact tracers, while California is aiming for 20,000.', '“This really is the best tool we have to manage the pandemic until we have a safe and effective vaccine,” says Crystal Watson at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\\\\nWill this system, combined with mask wearing and hand-washing, be enough to contain a patchwork pandemic?', 'Complicating matters, people with COVID-19 can spread the coronavirus before showing symptoms.', 'And yet, that hasn’t fazed other countries.', 'South Korea has been rightly praised for its success, and though one nightclub-goer recently sparked a surge of at least 168 cases, the country seems to have contained this new outbreak too .', 'Basic public-health measures have similarly worked in countries as diverse as Iceland, Jordan, Singapore, Germany, and New Zealand.', 'And they have suppressed epidemics of the past, from smallpox in the 19th century to Ebola in 2014.', '“Some silver bullet isn’t going to save us.', 'We can save ourselves,” says Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at Yale.', '“We have very old-school tools that beat fucking smallpox .”\\\\nBut those very old-school tools must also contend with old-school problems, which are difficult to recognize, let alone beat.\\\\nIII.', 'The Patchwork Legacy\\\\nThe current patchwork is not random.', 'Nor is it solely the consequence of America’s actions in 2020.', 'It has emerged from a much older, deeper patchwork .\\\\nU.S.', 'policies that evicted Native Americans from their own lands have long left indigenous peoples with insufficient shelter, water, and resources, making them vulnerable to infectious diseases like smallpox, cholera, malaria, dysentery, and now COVID-19 .', 'Up to 40 percent of the 170,000-person Navajo (Diné) Nation have no running water; they can’t effectively wash their hands.', 'About 30 percent have no power; they burn coal or wood for heat, resulting in irritated lungs that are vulnerable to a respiratory pandemic—a problem exacerbated by uranium mining on their lands.', 'Chronic underfunding has saddled them with crowded living conditions through which the virus easily spreads, dispersed health-care facilities that are low on beds and ventilators , and high rates of chronic conditions that increase the odds of dying from COVID-19.', '“The lack of basic services on the reservation isn’t due to our choosing to live this way,” wrote Wahleah Johns , a Diné woman, in The New York Times.', '“It’s because treaties and federal policies dictate how we live.”\\\\nThanks to traumas that accrued over generations and stressors that accrue over individual lives, the Navajo Nation has more per capita cases of COVID-19 than any U.S. state and nine times as many per capita deaths as neighboring Arizona.', 'While Arizona has loosened its distancing restrictions, the Navajo Nation has been forced to tighten its orders.\\\\nBlack Americans have fared little better.', 'After the Civil War, white leaders deliberately kept health care away from black communities.', 'For decades, former slave states wielded political influence to exclude black workers from the social safety net, or to ensure that the new wave of southern hospitals would avoid black communities, reject black doctors, and segregate black patients.', '“Federal health-care policy was designed, both implicitly and explicitly, to exclude black Americans,” wrote the journalist Jeneen Interlandi for The New York Times’ 1619 Project .\\\\nIbram X. Kendi: Stop blaming black people for dying of the coronavirus\\\\nThis is one reason why the U.S. still relies on employer-based insurance, which black people have always struggled to access.', 'Such a system “was the only fit for a modernizing society that could not abide black citizens sharing in societal benefits,” wrote my colleague Vann Newkirk II .', 'Over the past century, every move toward universal health care, and thus toward narrower racial inequities, was fiercely opposed.', 'The Affordable Care Act, which almost halved the proportion of uninsured black Americans below the age of 65, was most strongly fought by several states with large proportions of black citizens.\\\\nLast year, when the Global Health Security Index graded every country on its pandemic preparedness, the United States had the highest overall score, 83.5.', 'But on access to health care specifically, it scored just 25.3.', '(Out of 195 countries, it tied with The Gambia for 175th place.)', 'That is at least partly the consequence of letting segregationist tenets influence the allocation of health care.', '“The resulting arrangement all but guarantees an inadequate national response to a national crisis,” wrote Amy Kapczynski and Gregg Gonsalves of Yale .\\\\nIn almost every state, COVID-19 disproportionately infects and kills people of color —a pattern that Ibram X. Kendi has called “ a racial pandemic within the viral pandemic .” Pundits have been quick to blame poor health or unsafe choices, without considering the roots of either.', 'Racism in policing means that many black people don’t feel safe wearing the masks that would protect their neighbors.', 'Racism in medicine means that black patients receive poorer health-care than white ones.', 'Racism in policy has left black neighborhoods with less healthy food and more pollution, and black bodies with higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, stress, and what the demographer Arline Geronimus calls “ weathering ”—poor health that results from a lifetime of discrimination and disadvantage.', '“When America catches a cold, black people get the flu,” says Rashawn Ray, a sociologist at the University of Maryland.', '“In 2020, when America catches COVID-19, black people die .”\\\\nThese inequities will likely widen.', 'Even before the pandemic, inequalities in poverty and access to health care “were concentrated in southern parts of the country, and in states that are politically red,” says Tiffany Joseph, a sociologist at Northeastern University.', 'Not coincidentally, she says, those same states have tended to take social-distancing measures less seriously and reopen earlier.', 'The price of those decisions will be disproportionately paid by black people.\\\\nAdam Serwer: The coronavirus was an emergency until Trump found out who was dying\\\\nVulnerability to COVID-19 isn’t just about frequently discussed biological factors like being old; it’s also about infrequently discussed social ones.', 'If people don’t have health insurance, or can afford to live only in areas with poorly funded hospitals, they cannot fight off the virus as those with more advantages can.', 'If people work in poor-paying jobs that can’t be done remotely, have to commute by public transportation, or live in crowded homes, they cannot protect themselves from infection as those with more privilege can.\\\\nThese social factors explain why the idea of “cocooning” vulnerable populations while the rest of society proceeds as normal is facile.', 'That cocooning already exists, and it is a bug of the system, not a feature.', 'Entire groups of people have been pushed to the fringes of society and jammed into potential hot zones.', 'Of the 100 largest clusters of COVID-19 in the U.S. , nearly all have occurred in prisons , meatpacking plants , nursing homes , and psychiatric or developmental-care facilities.', '(The only exceptions are a naval vessel and three power plants; the infamous Grand Princess cruise is only No.', '148 on the list.', ')\\\\nThese places, along with homeless shelters and immigrant detention centers , are hubs for outbreaks that can easily spread to the surrounding communities.', 'Prisons and nursing homes have staff and visitors who live in nearby towns.', 'Large prisons, in particular, are usually situated in rural areas with small community hospitals that can be easily overrun by an outbreak.', 'And many employees in nursing homes and meatpacking plants are immigrants who care for the nation’s elderly and process its steaks while also being cut off from health care by the Trump administration’s policies .', 'They are both more likely to get sick, and less likely to get better.\\\\nThis point cannot be overstated: The pandemic patchwork exists because the U.S. is a patchwork to its core.', 'New outbreaks will continue to flare and fester unless the country makes a serious effort to protect its most vulnerable citizens, recognizing that their risk is the result of societal failures, not personal ones.', '“People say you can’t fix the U.S. health system overnight, but if we’re not fixing these underlying problems, we won’t get out of this,” says Sheila Davis of Partners in Health.', '“We’ll just keep getting pop-ups.”\\\\nLeaders can specifically place testing sites in poor, black, and brown communities, rather than the rich, white areas where they tend to be concentrated .', 'New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for example, is turning 24 churches in low-income areas into testing centers, while Maryland Governor Larry Hogan placed a testing facility in the heart of the predominantly black Prince George’s County.', 'Officials can remove people from risky environments: Leann Bertsch, who directs the North Dakota Department of Corrections, has argued that prisoners should be freed if they are over 50, have serious illnesses, or are within two years of parole or release.', 'A bipartisan group of 14 senators has made a similar call for decarceration .\\\\nPolicies can also support people in protecting themselves.', 'Essential workers earn low hourly wages and cannot afford to miss a shift, even

congressional allies, the former vice president is “racing to assemble a new governing agenda” that is “far bolder than anything the party establishment has embraced before.” As examples of this “exponentially bigger” agenda, Burns cited conversations the Biden campaign is having about massive new investments in public works and the green economy, a push to expand health care and child care, stronger labor protections, and new requirements that corporations share their wealth with their workers.\", 'The article lingered over discussions within Democratic policy circles about a universal basic income, a federal jobs guarantee, a revised tax code, and an effort to rebuild America’s manufacturing base.\\\\nYet, in more than 2,000 words, it offered no details about foreign policy at all.', 'Similarly, Gabriel Debenedetti of New York magazine recently described Biden’s plans for a presidency “more ambitious than FDR’s,” but largely avoided international affairs.\\\\nThese omissions are telling.', 'While the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to win over Bernie Sanders voters have pushed the Biden campaign to embrace a more ambitious domestic agenda, little evidence indicates that the presumptive Democratic nominee is doing anything comparable on international affairs.', 'That’s a pity, because America’s relationship with the world needs dramatic rethinking too.\\\\nLast week, the Biden and Sanders campaigns unveiled six “ unity task forces ” to rally Democrats around an agenda that merges Biden’s incrementalist instincts with Sanders’s more transformative ones.', 'The task forces—which include big names like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, John Kerry, and former Attorney General Eric Holder—cover climate change, criminal-justice reform, the economy, education, health care, and immigration.', 'Foreign policy isn’t on the list.\\\\nThe Biden campaign does have foreign-policy working groups, lots of them.', 'They’re broken down into subcategories: defense, intelligence, the Middle East, and so forth.', 'Democratic-foreign-policy insiders told me that these panels include hundreds of wonks, who produce reams of documents, which are sent to top Biden advisers like Antony Blinken, Julianne Smith, and Tom Donilon.', 'But the working groups don’t wield much power; one former Obama-administration official characterized them to me as “window dressing.” And because the identities of the people chairing them are secret, they are harder to influence than the unity task forces established on domestic policy.', '“The fact that they don’t have a public foreign-policy working group means advocates are jumping through hoops to figure out who to talk to,” one progressive foreign-policy activist told me.', '“It makes it harder and more challenging to communicate with the campaign.” (This activist and the former Obama-administration official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.', ')\\\\nThis comparative secrecy might be less of a concern had Biden laid out a more specific foreign-policy agenda.', 'But compared with his major primary rivals, he’s been vague.', 'Take the defense budget.', 'During the primary, Elizabeth Warren proposed cutting military spending by $800 billion over 10 years.', 'Sanders suggested cutting it by $1.2 trillion over 12 years.', 'Biden’s plans are more opaque.', 'A February 2019 Politico survey identified him as one of the candidates who wanted to “boost the defense budget.” In November, by contrast, he told Military Times, “We can maintain a strong defense and protect our safety and security for less.” Reading the entrails, the Brookings Institution’s Thomas Wright suggested in The Atlantic in March that while “defense-budget cuts are possible” in a Biden administration, “top priorities are reforming and modernizing the military to reflect new technologies and repairing civil-military relations.”\\\\nIn other words, Biden isn’t planning to expend much political capital to shrink the Pentagon.', 'Stephen Miles, the executive director of the progressive advocacy group Win Without War, told me he worries that a Biden administration may embrace the principle of “parity,” in which—to gain Republican support in Congress—“domestic investments like health care, education, and infrastructure must be matched dollar for dollar with more money for the Pentagon’s bloated budget.” Laicie Heeley, a former analyst with the Budgeting for Foreign Affairs and Defense program at the Stimson Center, predicted to me, “When it comes to defense, a Biden presidency is likely to look very much like an Obama presidency, and that’s going to look not so different from a Trump presidency when you really look at the numbers.”\\\\nThe pandemic—which has already killed roughly 30 times as many Americans as 9/11—offers Biden the chance to break out of the parameters established by his predecessors.', 'As the national-security analysts Joseph Cirincione and William Hartung recently noted in The National Interest, the U.S. spends $740 billion a year on the military and $11 billion on global public health.', 'Hospitals teeter on the edge of bankruptcy while the Pentagon spends about $500 million a year on marching bands.\\\\nBiden could use these ghastly discrepancies to challenge the view that military spending can only be trimmed at the edges.', 'One way to do that is by demanding that the Pentagon pass an audit, something—as Fareed Zakaria recently pointed out —it has never done.', 'Another is to aggressively challenge the Trump administration’s plans for massive increases in spending on nuclear weapons.', 'A third is to call for the repeal of the 2001 and 2002 congressional resolutions that have given three presidents the power to wage war for nearly two decades.', 'On his website, Biden says he’ll “ end forever wars .” But unless he ends the legal basis upon which those forever wars rest, the U.S. is likely to continue dispatching Special Forces and launching drone strikes with minimal congressional oversight.\\\\nInstead of challenging the Pentagon’s sky-high budget, Biden’s highest-profile foreign-policy foray since clinching the Democratic nomination has been to try to out-hawk Donald Trump on China.', 'In April, the Biden campaign ran an ad, filled with menacing images of Chinese troops, that accused Trump of having “ r olled over for the Chinese .” A pro-Biden super PAC accused the president of “outright acquiescence to China.” Getting to Trump’s right on China may strike Biden’s advisers as a shrewd way to neutralize the GOP’s line of attack.', 'But it perpetuates the Cold War narrative that hawks are already using to sustain massive defense spending.\\\\nThe impetus to out-hawk Trump also makes it harder for Biden to expand America’s commitment to the World Health Organization, which the president and his allies have derided as a tool of Beijing.', 'On his website, Biden proposes greater international cooperation against COVID-19.', 'His campaign, however, has spent far more energy bashing China than defending the WHO—thus helping to create a political climate that makes such cooperation harder.', 'It’s another example of Biden’s refusal to do in foreign policy what he appears ready to do in domestic policy: Use the pandemic to fundamentally reshape the American political debate.\\\\nJust because Biden isn’t laying out a transformative foreign-policy vision doesn’t mean he wouldn’t be a significant improvement over Donald Trump.', 'Blinken, Jake Sullivan, and Colin Kahl, who served as Biden’s national-security advisers while he was vice president and remain influential now, are widely regarded as thoughtful, capable, and decent.\\\\nThe problem is that Biden’s political team appears convinced that, while campaigning on an ambitious progressive domestic agenda would boost his election prospects, campaigning on an ambitious progressive international agenda could leave him vulnerable to Trump’s jingoistic attacks.', 'As a result, Biden is failing to use the pandemic to win a mandate for a radically different foreign policy.', 'Given what Democrats should have learned in recent months—about the desperate need to free up money to fight off a near-depression, and the desperate need to improve international

the opposition gets to ask the prime minister six questions, live and face-to-face.\\\\nRead: Britain just got pulled back from the edge\\\\nAs a former lawyer, Starmer has used these sessions to prosecute a sharply defined case against the government.', 'The first time he faced Boris Johnson, his initial question was open-ended and unanswerable.', 'The prime minister had hailed the “apparent success” of the government’s approach, even as Britain recorded the highest death toll in Europe, Starmer said.', '“That is not success, or apparent success, so can the Prime Minister tell us: How on earth did it come to this?” The next week, Starmer flustered Johnson again with a question about elderly care, leading to a beautifully childish rebuttal from an unnamed Downing Street source, quoted in the Financial Times: “Keir Starmer is the one who was rattled.” The FT also reported that the prime minister’s team wanted an end to social distancing in the Commons sessions in order to get more cheering supporters behind him during such encounters.\\\\nStarmer is an interesting test case for how to oppose during a crisis, because he became the Labour leader in early April, after Britain was already under lockdown.', 'He has only been a crisis leader.', 'He entered the job carrying little political baggage; commentators have found identifying his precise political beliefs difficult.', 'In his very first speech, accepting the leadership, Starmer promised to “engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake.” His precise jabs at Prime Minister’s Questions allow him to maintain that line.', 'He also secured a prime-time slot on the BBC to respond to Johnson’s plan to ease the lockdown, during which he voiced statesmanlike praise of key workers, rather than overtly partisan attacks on the prime minister.\\\\nHis approach has been calibrated to deal with the government’s current popularity—while betting that it will not last.', '“There isn’t a mood for slashing political attacks,” Saunders said.', '“There is a mood for careful questions on [personal protective equipment] not being delivered.” Starmer’s bet is that social distancing, and the economic disruption it brings, will last for many months, and that the government’s poll lead will start to wither.', 'At that point, he will have a track record of established criticisms to point to, rather than seeming opportunistic.\\\\nThe judgment call for any opposition leader during a national crisis is how to move between acknowledging the size of the government’s task, contributing to a sense of solidarity, and criticizing specific policy failings.', 'Michael Howard, who was the Conservative leader when terrorists killed 52 people in London in July 2005, told me that it was important for an opposition not to undermine “a sense of national cohesion.” In the first Prime Minister’s Questions after those bombings, he did not go on the attack, but instead offered sympathy to the families of those killed, and made a nonpartisan point about the importance of not blaming British Muslims for Islamist terror.', '“Where you pitch the balance will vary from crisis to crisis,” he said.', '“I think [Starmer] probably just kept inside the line—just—of not overstepping the mark.”\\\\nHoward pointed out another pressure that opposition leaders face—from lawmakers within their own party, who might relish tough talk.', 'Starmer beat the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s preferred candidate to the party leadership, and some of his colleagues , as well as left-wing activists , would like to see him challenge the government more strongly.\\\\nBritish voters should be glad that Starmer is providing effective opposition—whether they support his party or not.', 'As my colleague

service Roku, but the majority of One America’s viewers are, like Trump, TV watchers.', 'In order to watch it on TV, you have to live in the right place, because only a smattering of U.S. cable

'The Herrings don’t participate in Nielsen surveys and have declined to share subscriber data.', 'But according to the scant available data from Comscore and conversations with industry analysts, at least 34.5 million of those households are not watching OAN.\\\\nThe more you search for evidence of OAN viewers, in fact, the less they seem to exist.', '“If you look at the constellation of sources

Amherst.', '“That surprised me … but it seems like they’re really focused on being a TV network rather than a multimedia platform.” Indeed, most of the segments on OAN’s YouTube page have just a few thousand views.', 'OAN often gets compared to Breitbart News, but it exemplifies a reversal of Brietbart’s strategy under Steve Bannon, which sought to leverage social media aggressively.', 'One

Trump picked a fight with the protective-mask manufacturer 3M , One America aired a segment about a San Antonio–area nurse who’d made a medical-grade face mask that, according to the OAN anchor’s opening line, “works even better than 3M’s N95 mask.” The nurse boasted about her mask’s 99.5 percent filtration rate (which, if true, would be better than 3M’s) and the fact that so far she’d made 600 of them.', 'The premise of this segment seemed to be: Eat it, 3M!', 'Just a few commercial breaks later, an advertisement urged viewers who’d suffered hearing damage from faulty earplugs to join a class-action lawsuit against … 3M.', 'Coincidence?', 'Maybe.', 'In One America’s America, though, there are no coincidences.', 'Everything is a conspiracy.\\\\nAll of One America’s anchors bear an uncanny resemblance to more famous anchors on other networks.', 'The bespectacled, babyish-faced Alex Salvi hosts a prime-time show called After Hours that airs at 10 p.m., but before you get any naughty ideas, it’s more like watching a high-school production of All In With Chris Hayes.', 'Then there’s Graham Ledger, who spent nearly 15 years anchoring San Diego’s KFMB-TV local news, which means that, yes, prior to joining WealthTV and One America, he was Anchorman’s Ron Burgundy.', 'You could spend all day fuming about border security and still fall asleep face-first into a bowl of Ledger’s word soup.', 'One of the soft bigotries of right-leaning opinion journalism is that brunettes don’t get to be righteously indignant—this is a job for spitfire blondes.', 'Liz Wheeler, the host of 9 p.m.’s Tipping Point, is a slightly desiccated Megyn Kelly whose hobbies include emasculating the libs.', 'If Ledger is OAN’s bid to take back the Anchorman archetype, Wheeler is a conservative fantasy of Ron Burgundy’s love interest and rival co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone.\\\\nDoppelgängers abound.', 'Patrick Hussion, who hosts OAN nightly news at 5 p.m., which is technically the late afternoon, looks haunted, like a half-in-the-bag David Muir.', 'John Hines, who interviews many of OAN’s big gets—regulars include Representative Devin Nunes of California and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar—has mastered Chris Wallace’s very sober manner, right down to the very sober head tilt.', 'Wallace, though, is a born inquisitor.', 'Hines is trained to heel.', 'One afternoon, I watched him hold an expression of squinty encouragement for nearly five unbroken minutes as Nunes went on about a “highly suspicious” weapons lab in Wuhan and about the World Health Organization’s alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.\\\\nIf you’ve encountered OAN out in the world, though, it’s probably not because of Ledger or Hines or Hussion.', 'One America gets talked about for one overriding reason: Trump keeps calling on its correspondents during press conferences.', 'By now, a pattern has emerged.', 'He calls on an OAN correspondent; the correspondent asks a bewildering question; everyone in the briefing room turns around to see who the hell just asked the bewildering question; then Trump thanks the correspondent for serving up such an incisive meatball.', 'For weeks, Trump labored to shift blame for the pandemic onto China by referring to the coronavirus as the “China virus” or “Wuhan virus,” provoking charges of thinly veiled racism.', 'He received a helpful boost from OAN’s chief White House correspondent, Chanel Rion, whose name is pronounced Sha-nell Ree-ohn.', '(Rion is Korean American; her father’s surname is Ryan.)', 'Her question on the matter was more akin to a preemptive defense with a question mark stuck on the end: “Mr.', 'President, do you consider the term Chinese food to be racist because it is food that originated from China?”\\\\nRion does seem to have a knack for head-scratching behavior.', 'According to a Daily Mail investigation, she changed her surname from Dayn-Ryan to Rion shortly before applying for a White House security clearance (which is a peculiar moment to change your name).', 'The newspaper reported that Rion’s father, Dann Ryan, has gone by the names Christopher Preboth, Dan Ryan, Danford Nmi

people in real-estate scams.\\\\nEllen Cushing: I was a teenage conspiracist\\\\nBreaking news is very expensive and, for the Herrings and One America, very overrated.', 'Charles Herring has said that his family pumps tens of millions of dollars into One America, but for a national TV-news operation, that’s pennies in a bottomless well.', 'In all the hours I spent watching One America during the pandemic, I never saw evidence of a second camera in the studio.', 'I never saw a field correspondent deliver a report from anywhere other than the White House.', 'Some of the male anchors should not be dressing themselves.\\\\nIn any case, why break news when you can just repeat the already broken stuff?', 'When I emailed Charles about what he considers the high points of OAN’s history as a news network—an incisive meatball of my own—he didn’t seize the open invitation to boast.', '“The high points,” he replied, “are simply executing on our mission, namely providing credible national and international news.', 'Having staff break important news stories is always a high point for any news organization.” It sure is.', 'But he didn’t name any of those stories.\\\\nI thought Charles might tout the network’s hard-hitting coverage of the 2020 presidential election, in particular its coverage of Joe Biden.', 'A vague theme emerged from the many segments I watched—see if you can spot it: “Joe Biden stumbled through another interview today …” “Concerns about his cognitive decline are reportedly on the rise …” “Joe Biden’s gaffes continue—that’s according to his harshest critics.” (Yes, even Biden’s harshest critics were willing to speak out.)', 'The anchors hit their prescribed marks with a mixture of amusement and pity.', 'They could barely contain themselves at a clip of Biden referring to the coronavirus as “the Luhan virus.”\\\\nIn my email exchange with Charles, I tried to nail down a few more answers.', 'Given the tenor of One America’s pandemic coverage, I asked him if he personally knew anyone who had become ill with COVID-19.', 'For some reason, he didn’t want to reply on the record.', 'I also asked him for examples of times OAN has had to correct its work, because I couldn’t find very many myself.', '“Unfortunately, we make errors on a frequent basis,” he replied.', '“Most are very minor and simply corrected.', 'At times, we’ve made on air corrections.” One correction I did find was a “report removal” tweet walking back an infidelity accusation; the tweet repeated the original accusation and stated that the item was removed “pending additional sourcing.” Charles is right about how often One America gets things wrong, but wrong about how often One America sets them right.\\\\nDespite its tiny audience, One America can still be a useful vector for propagandists, both foreign and domestic, even unwittingly.', 'A conspiracy theory that pops up only in, say, a Russian propaganda organ, or in the mouth of a spiral-eyed congressman, can’t travel as widely as one that receives some sort of American media imprimatur, however shabby.\\\\nThis requires a bit of a dance to work.', 'For instance, a guest can speculate ominously about Chinese plots, but the interviewer has to sit there, thunderstruck by the logic of it all, and not ask even the most basic of questions.', 'Okay, walk me through this: Scientists in a Chinese bioweapons lab developed the coronavirus and then ... what?', 'Turned it loose on their own people?', 'Or did it get out by accident—a monkey escaped, a test tube spilled, that sort of thing?', 'Liberated from critical probing, innuendo does its work.\\\\nFor years, coastal elites roared with laughter at Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert as they dressed up as newsmen and turned a familiar ritual of American life into a nightly punch line.', 'Throughout the Obama presidency, liberals comforted themselves with the idea that they’d mocked a certain kind of news program out of existence, and that sanity had triumphed.', 'But during Barack Obama’s second term, the post-truth pendulum swung back hard, from left to far right, from parody to propaganda, from Obama doctrine to Trumpism.\\\\nOne America may be Donald Trump’s favorite news network, but that doesn’t mean he stays up all night watching it.', 'If there’s one thing we can all agree that Trump really does know something about, it’s good (“good”) television, and I just can’t picture him having any patience for One America’s production values.', '“The key to success in this space is that you actually have to look enough like a news network to have some influence … and that’s what Breitbart did incredibly well,” Zuckerman, the media analyst, said.', '“It really has to have luster and gloss to it.', 'And then when it’s simultaneously disturbing, that’s when it has power.” OAN, though, skipped the luster-and-gloss part.', 'Zuckerman went on, “If you don’t have it—even if the product is really provocative—it’s going to fail.”\\\\nSo many times while watching One America, I went back and forth about how “dangerous” it is, how alarmed we should be, what threat level it represents.', 'One America’s sponsorship roster remains on the skimpy side—appliance insurance, class-action suits against Trump foes, a selection from the William Shatner oeuvre.', 'The network has survived this long only because of the oxygen hose that Trump provides.', 'And when he’s gone?', 'One America isn’t Fox News.', 'The Herrings aren’t the Murdochs.', 'Someone else will replace them.', 'It might be someone with much better news chops.', 'It might be someone more insidiously adept at using the cover of journalism to erode trust in journalism.', 'It might even be people with ties to Trump.', 'According to news reports , the investment firm owned by the family of the Republican National Committee co-chair and Texas investor Tommy Hicks Jr., a friend of Donald Trump Jr., has been exploring possible options.\\\\nCharles Herring demurred when I asked him about the rumors.', '“We didn’t build OAN to sell it and we are excited about the future,” he wrote.', '“We’ll look at any growth opportunities, yet we are not looking to sell our business.”

something different now?\\\\nRapke: That’s a hard question.', 'My answer is always: It depends, as a psychologist.', 'The content is technically the same, our role in the hospital is still the same, but our method of doing that is very different right now.', 'Normally, I’m physically in the hospital five days a week, so virtual is all new for us.', 'And we’re also really only seeing people when they absolutely have to be here, so the cases we’re seeing are a little bit more severe.\\\\nJames Hamblin: When we talk about depression, often the medical system has the job of distinguishing: Is this a context-dependent situation where it’s going to go away?', 'And at what point it becomes a pathology.\\\\nI understand it is a spectrum, but you as a clinician, you have to decide whether or not someone gets that diagnosis in their chart or doesn’t.', 'There’s kind of a black line that has to be drawn because of the way the system is arranged, at least.', 'And I’m wondering if that line has changed for you at all in the current situation.\\\\nRapke: I see it on a continuum.', 'All of us have varying levels of depression at different points in our life.', 'All of us have varying levels of mood swings at points in our lives.', 'When does it get to the point where, as a profession, we draw this line?', 'The DSM is the main way we do that, where you have to meet certain numbers of criteria, but I never want a family to feel like that discounts their experience.', 'So I don’t in any way want people to misunderstand that just because we don’t say that it gets this code doesn’t mean that that discounts their experience.\\\\nJust to go back, it has changed a little bit.', 'At what point would we just talk to a friend?', 'It’s very similar to medical triage, but it’s sort of developing what those levels are.', 'Can I call a friend and feel better, and that sort of changes things?', 'Or have I called all the friends, baked all the cookies, and I still can’t seem to get out of this funk?', 'That’s sort of the first level.', 'If getting up and going for a walk, doing things that would normally help me feel better, talking to somebody that always helps me—if that doesn’t do anything, now we’re to the next point of: How long have I been feeling this way?', 'Has it been just today?', 'Or has it been lasting several days, where I really can’t seem to get myself out of this state?\\\\nAt that point, you really need to reach out to somebody, whether you have a pastor or a good friend that has a little bit of experience or knowledge.', 'It’s at that point that maybe you need to reach out and do a little bit of screening, maybe even go online to some of the screeners online, some of the reliable ones through your local hospital.\\\\nAnd then I think at that point, if that screener comes up, if your friend who normally can snap you out of it thinks this is more than your normal funk, then it’s time.', 'You definitely have to reach out to somebody, whether it’s a hotline, your pediatrician, a counselor you’ve talked to in the past.\\\\nWells: Those three levels you were describing for kind of self-assessment of how severe things are—do those change, given the fact that so many people are going through traumatic experiences right now, like job loss and death in the family up to housing and food insecurity?', 'Like, does it change how you think about those levels or—\\\\nRapke: I think those levels maybe are the same all the time.', 'I think the pace of those levels probably changes right now.', 'Because normally you can leave the house, you can go somewhere, you can do fun things.', 'And if you can’t do that right now, that probably speeds up the timeline a little bit because the resources that you would have to try to snap yourself out of it are more limited.\\\\nWells: Something Jim and I have been talking about a lot, and I’ve been joking about it, is, like, we’re all so depressed.', 'It’s a depressing time.', 'Everything’s horrible.', 'Of course we’re depressed.', 'But I feel like this is a good reminder that of course this is a depressing and sad situation and there’s so many things happening that are worthy of mourning, but clinical depression is not necessarily feeling sad because something bad has happened.', 'It sounds like you diagnose less on the initial feeling and more on the ability to cope with the feeling?\\\\nRapke: There are specific content criteria for depression or anxiety.', 'But the big thing that really distinguishes that continuum where we all have some level of sadness and depression is: Is it impairing our functioning?', 'Are we able to still take care of our children, to take care of our pets, to do whatever job or tasks we’re needing to do?\\\\nMaslow’s hierarchy of needs is a thing I go back to all the time.', 'One of the weekends that I worked on the crisis line, I spoke to this woman who is in a lot of distress and I said: “You are trying to care for all of these people

formula.”\\\\nLet’s take care of these things first, because in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the base of the pyramid—and you can’t function without a good base—is food, water, shelter.', 'So if I can’t feed myself, if I can’t feed my family, if I can’t have a roof over my head, if I can’t have basic clothing to keep myself warm and survive, I can’t do other things.\\\\nSo anytime I have someone that’s in crisis, that’s how I organize their concerns: Let’s focus on the basic, core things and make sure that you feel secure in that.', 'And then maybe you’ll feel more capable of doing these other things.\\\\nSo the takeaways are functioning, distress, and then: Am I about where everybody else is?', 'I think that’s where the COVID question comes in.', 'Are we all clinically depressed, or are we all just adjusting to a really stressful situation?\\\\nHamblin: It sounds similar to how an internal-medicine doctor doesn’t want to see someone coming into the hospital already in multi-organ failure and delirious.', 'It would have been much easier to know that person at their baseline and see them a bit earlier.', 'And in psychiatry it’s never ideal to hear from someone for the first time when they can’t go to the food pantry or can’t get off their couch and can’t do the things they know they normally would be able to just because they’re in the depths of depression.\\\\nAt the same time, we have a lot of people feeling these symptoms, and it sounds like if we put the entire burden on the mental-health system and had everyone who was in the early stages of these symptoms reach out, there would be an overwhelming wave.', 'And so things like food and housing insecurity—these things that might be at the root of some of the hopelessness and despair people are feeling—are systemic issues that we can’t put all on mental-health care later, because people can’t deal with these circumstances.', 'It’s the circumstances that we can fix.', 'Otherwise, we’ll just see this flood as it builds up in people who meet these criteria, but we could have prevented it.\\\\nRapke: Yeah, ideally we would be doing more primary prevention.', 'The ratio would be more about doing the food and shelter and water and housing first, and then that would trickle down to other stuff.', 'Secondary prevention is sort of a targeting of risk populations.', 'And then tertiary prevention is you’re just trying to not make it worse.', 'Unfortunately, most of the time we’re doing tertiary.', 'I would love to see, as a society, as a community, more primary efforts.', 'But that’s really complex, especially right now when resources are super tapped.\\\\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.', \"Submit a letter to the editor or write to
